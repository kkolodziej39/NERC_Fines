ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),"PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM)",NCR00879,RFC2016015939,Settlement Agreement  ,"On July 15, 2016, PJM submitted a Self-Report stating that, as a Transmission Operator, it was in violation of TOP-004-2 R2.  The Self-Report relates to an incident that occurred on May 5, 2016 in which FirstEnergy Utilities, as agent for Monongahela Power Company (FirstEnergy), did not fully arm a Special Protection Scheme (SPS) pursuant to PJM’s instruction.  There was no outage or loss of load.  Even if a loss of load occurred, the incident would not have qualified as a reportable event under EOP-004-2.  On May 5, 2016, the Belmont - Harrison 500 kV line, owned by FirstEnergy, tripped and locked out at 16:59 due to storms in the area of Parkersburg, WV.  Shortly after the Belmont-Harrison line tripped, FirstEnergy’s contingency analysis tool showed that there were two unsolved contingencies.  As a result, the FE South operator immediately informed the entity about the unsolved contingencies, and in response, the entity operator instructed FE South operators to arm the Belmont SPS.  Arming this SPS requires selecting the condition (loss of the Belmont-Harrison 500 kV line) and selecting a generating unit at Pleasants Generation Station (Pleasants) to trip.  The SPS acts by tripping the selected Pleasants unit if the Belmont T5 765/500kV transformer trips, thereby preventing instability at Pleasants.

FE South operators called the Generator Operator to determine which unit to designate to trip in the SPS.  However, when arming the SPS, the FE South operators did not select a unit to trip and thus did not fully arm the SPS.  As a result, there was the potential for generator unit instability at Pleasants Generation Station and localized overloads on the 138 kV lines in the Parkersburg, WV area. 

Shortly thereafter, at 17:15, the FE South operator informed the entity that they believed the SPS was in service.  When properly put in service, the SPS logic would remove the non-solving contingencies from FirstEnergy’s contingency list.  However, the entity responded that its system was showing that the SPS was not armed. 

FirstEnergy immediately began investigating the discrepancy, and determined that it skipped a manual step required to arm the SPS.  At 18:54, the SPS was properly put in service.

The root cause of this miscommunication was the FE South Operator not effectively following the procedure for arming the SPS combined with lack of a clear indication on FirstEnergy’s SPS energy management system screen as to the status of the SPS.  These causes involve the management practice of verification, which includes ensuring changes to assets are completed as intended according to the relevant process.

Pursuant to Section 5.11 of the Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program, ReliabilityFirst determined that FirstEnergy was wholly responsible for the actions or omissions that caused or contributed to the violation.",TOP-004-2,R2,High,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  By not fully arming the SPS, there was the potential for generator unit instability at Pleasants Generation Station, which could have caused units at Pleasants (approximately 1,050 MW) to trip off, and the potential for a localized outage in the Parkersburg, WV area, with the total consequential loss of load limited to 145 MW.  Thus, an event, had it occurred, would not have constituted a reportable event under Reliability Standard EOP-004-2. ReliabilityFirst determined that the loss of the Pleasants units would not have caused a cascading event to the Bulk Electric System. The risk to the system was also mitigated because the entity had sufficient spinning reserves (1,800 MW) to offset any potential loss.  This was confirmed through a Dynamic Stability Cascade Analysis study performed by FirstEnergy. ReliabilityFirst reviewed this study, verified the inputs, and agreed with FirstEnergy’s conclusion.

No harm is known to have occurred.  ","5/5/2016 At 17:14, when FirstEnergy believed it fully armed the SPS","5/5/2016 At 18:54, when FirstEnergy properly armed the SPS","$34,000 ",Self-Report,"To mitigate this violation, FirstEnergy : 

1) reviewed and updated their Belmont SPS EMS screen to be more intuitive and provide a positive indication of SPS status;
2) revised its procedure “FE-SOUTH-NOP-226 FE-South Special Protection System Operation” with updated instructions for the Belmont SPS; and
3) retrained its operators on the process to place the Belmont SPS in service.

While the parties disagreed as to whether the facts and circumstances at issue involved the “single most severe contingency” and “instability” as used in TOP-004-2 R2, FirstEnergy nonetheless mitigated the issue and implemented preventive measures, thus significantly reducing the likelihood of recurrence. ",10/19/2016,2/7/2017,Neither Admits nor Denies,"ReliabilityFirst reviewed the entity’s and FirstEnergy’s internal compliance programs (ICPs) and considered them to be mitigating factors in the penalty determination.  For example, entity senior management, including the entity executive team and the entity Board of Managers for the corporate compliance program, is involved in compliance matters.  The entity has also established a formal compliance review committee, known as the Regulatory Oversight and Compliance Committee, which is charged with evaluating identified compliance issues and recommended actions from entity senior management and, ultimately, the entity Board of Managers.  Furthermore, the entity established compliance with NERC and Regional Reliability Standards as a corporate goal.  FirstEnergy's ICP is managed by its FERC & State Regulatory Compliance Department (FERC Compliance), which has corporate oversight responsibilities and is independent from FirstEnergy business units that are responsible for complying with the NERC Reliability Standards.  Business Unit “Compliance Champions” assist FERC Compliance with monitoring activities that encourage opportunities to increase reliability.   FE’s compliance program has strong support and participation of senior management who drive a culture that promotes continuous improvement with compliance.  The FERC Compliance Department is under the VP, Compliance & Regulated Services and Chief FERC Compliance Officer (VP/Chief FERC CO), who reports directly to the President, FirstEnergy Utilities, who reports to the CEO.  The VP/Chief FERC CO also has direct access to the CEO and leads the Executive Reliability Steering Committee.

ReliabilityFirst considered the entity’s and FirstEnergy’s TOP-004 R2 compliance history and determined there were no relevant instances of noncompliance.

PJM and FirstEnergy have been highly cooperative throughout the enforcement process. They voluntarily provided ReliabilityFirst with an abundance of information regarding the incident in a manner that was detailed, well-organized, and timely. They have been open with the ReliabilityFirst regarding this incident, processes, and systems, and this insight has allowed ReliabilityFirst to better analyze the facts. ReliabilityFirst awarded credit to encourage this sort of interaction in the future."

","Settlement Agreement
","On December 23, 2016, BPA submitted a Self-Report stating that, as a Transmission Owner, it was in violation of PRC-005-1.1b R2.

Specifically, BPA reported that on November 22, 2016, it discovered that a transfer trip analog device was installed at its Control Center, without indicating in the Asset Management System, critical information necessary to trigger priority and maintenance intervals for the device. Within the Asset Management System, the window for asset intake contained a system indicator designed to identify when a device is subject to the requirements of PRC-005-1.1b R2. In this case, the system indicator was not applied to the device, therefore the maintenance interval trigger did not operate as intended. The transfer trip analog device was installed in January 2008, and Protection System maintenance and testing should have been completed in March 2014 as defined by BPA’s Protection System Maintenance and Testing Program.   

After reviewing all the relevant information, WECC determined that BPA failed to implement its Protection System maintenance and testing program for one transfer trip analog device within its maximum maintenance interval as required by PRC-005-1.1b R2.  

The root cause of the violation was a lack of controls for new Protection System devices added to BPA’s Asset Management System, to verify accuracy and completeness.

WECC determined that this violation began on March 1, 2014, when the Protection System maintenance and testing was due for the transfer trip analog device and ended on March 28, 2016, when maintenance and testing were completed for the transfer trip analog device, for a total of 759 days of noncompliance.

In this instance, BPA failed to implement its Protection System maintenance and testing program for one transfer trip analog device within its maximum maintenance interval as required by PRC-005-1.1b R2. Such failure could result in a device misoperation leading to a loss of generation or damage to the associated 230 kV transmission elements if the device failed to send the signal to trip. Therefore, WECC assessed the potential harm to the security and reliability of the BPS as intermediate.  

However, BPA had good compensating controls. If the transfer trip had failed to operate, BPA would have dropped generation. BPA has many generation drop contingencies in place to address a failed transfer trip. Based on this, WECC determined that there was a low likelihood of causing intermediate harm to the BPS. No harm is known to have occurred.

",Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM),NCR05333,WECC2017016932,Settlement Agreement,"On February 6, 2017, PNM submitted a Self-Report stating that, as a Transmission Owner, it was in violation of PRC-008-0 R2.  

Specifically, PNM reported that during an internal investigation for an unrelated issue, it discovered that it failed to implement its maintenance and testing program for 14 of its 75 (18.7%) Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) devices, as required by PRC-008-0 R2.  Three of the UFLS devices had completed work orders but were missing the associated test record for the prior maintenance activities.  The remaining 10 UFLS devices did not have a completed work order or an associated test record for either a last or prior test. One relay missed its maintenance interval. None of the UFLS devices had been transitioned to PRC-005-6 at the time the violation was identified, so each UFLS system was still subject to PRC-008-0 at the time the issue was discovered.

After reviewing all relevant information, WECC determined that PNM failed to implement its UFLS equipment maintenance and testing program for 13 (not 14 as originally self-reported) of its 75 (17.3%) UFLS devices as required by PRC-008-0 R2.

The root cause of the noncompliance was due to management guidance or expectations not being well-defined, understood, or enforced.  Specifically, PNM management did not require that a formal process be in place to ensure test records for each maintenance activity were uploaded upon completion of the maintenance and testing task, which resulted in gaps in the records of PNM’s maintenance and testing activities.

WECC determined that this violation began on June 18, 2007 when the Standard and Requirement became mandatory and enforceable to PNM, and ended on June 6, 2017, when the last of the UFLS devices in scope was tested and documented as being tested.
",PRC-008-0,R2,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the Bulk Power System (BPS). PNM failed to implement its UFLS equipment maintenance and testing program for 13 of its 75 (17.3%) UFLS devices as required by PRC-008-0 R2.  Such failure could potentially result in degradation of equipment, or cause a misoperation to occur that could result in unforeseen load shedding, or prevent planned load shedding from occurring. Of the 13 devices identified in this Self-Report, 3 (or 3/13 = 23.1% of self-reported UFLS devices) do not currently support WECC's Southern Island Under-Frequency Load Tripping Plan (SILTP).   As such, failure of these devices to operate to shed load during an under-frequency condition would have had no impact to the BPS and no impact to the SILTP.  The remaining 10 devices represent approximately 4% of PNM's total load.  As a worst-case scenario, failure of these devices to operate during an extreme under-frequency event equates to approximately 81 MW of load out of 714 MW included in the UFLS.  Therefore, WECC assessed the potential harm to the security and reliability of the BPS as minor. 

The UFLS devices in scope for this self-report were part of different 'Groups' within WECC's UFLS program.   Each 'Group' was designed to operate at different levels of frequency drop.  Group 1 devices, for example, comprise 5.3% of the armed load and are set to shed load at 59.5 Hz.  Group 2 devices, which comprise 5.9% of the armed load, do not shed load until the frequency drops again to 58.9 Hz.  The devices in scope for thisSelf-Report were spread across 5 separate 'Groups' in the UFLS program. Additionally, PNM’s system operators were trained and authorized to immediately shed firm load as necessary to address any system condition that threatened the reliability of the BPS, including manually shedding load to address extreme system conditions. Based on this, WECC determined that there was a low likelihood of causing minor harm to the BPS. No harm is known to have occurred.

4) perform an annual reconciliation to ensure that the Cascade data base remains consistent with the field inventory and establish an annual DocMinder, automated reminder, to trigger completion of the annual reconciliation;
5) implemented a formal procedure to include the collection, evidence review, and packaging and storage of evidence that maintenance had occurred to meet NERC compliance requirements; 
6) conducted training to craft supervisors, engineers from the Technical Maintenance Management Department, and management from all departments on the new procedure; and
7) generated an automated reminder in its work management system to perform an annual reconciliation of the UFLS devices.

WECC applied an aggravating factor and escalated the disposition treatment from Compliance Exceptions to a Settlement Agreement without a penalty.  The violation duration for PRC-008-0 R2 was 3,651 days; for PRC-011-0 R1 it was 3,606 days; and for PRC-017-0 R1 it was 3,629 days.

Specifically, PNM reported that during an internal investigation for an unrelated issue, it discovered that it did not track and document the dates for the last or prior maintenance and testing for two of its three (66.7%) Undervoltage Load Shedding (UVLS) schemes--specifically, 12 of 30 (40%) UVLS devices, which included one UVLS Transformer CVT, eight UVLS batteries, and three UVLS relays. For two of the three UVLS relays, PNM had located completed work orders but was unable to locate the associated test record for the prior maintenance activity. The third relay had a completed work order, but the associated test record for the last maintenance activity was missing; also, there was no work order and associated test record for the prior maintenance activity. The one UVLS transformer CVT and the eight UVLS batteries were never maintained. None of the UVLS systems had begun transitioning to PRC-005-6 at the time the issue was identified, so each UVLS system was still subject to PRC-011-0 at the time the issue was discovered.

After reviewing all relevant information, WECC determined that PNM failed to appropriately maintain its maintenance and testing records for 12 of 30 (40%) UVLS devices, as required by PRC-011-0 R1.

The root cause of the violation was due to management guidance or expectations not being well-defined, understood, or enforced.

Such failure could potentially result in degradation of equipment, or a misoperation that could result in planned load shedding not occurring or unforeseen load shedding. However, if the UVLS devices did not operate properly during sustained low voltages in the local area where the UVLS was installed, failure of the scheme to operate as designed would not necessarily have a broader impact of the surrounding transmission system. Therefore, WECC assessed the potential harm to the security and reliability of the BPS as minor. 

There was no actual impact to the system as both the schemes in scope have operated correctly for under-voltage conditions during the violation period. The one UVLS scheme operated correctly for an under-voltage condition on October 3, 2016. The other UVLS scheme operated correctly on December 8, 2016 and January 21, 2017 for low voltage conditions. Additionally, the devices that comprised the UVLS schemes and identified in the issue were designed to take independent actions, meaning failure of one device in the scheme would not impact the ability of the other devices to operate properly. The scheme was designed to mitigate low voltages in a local area and has not been identified as needed for broader protection of the BPS. Two of PNM's neighboring Transmission Owners/Operators also have UVLS schemes to address low voltages in the affected area and the likelihood of these adjacent schemes failing simultaneously with PNM's UVLS Scheme is low.

Specifically, PNM reported that during an internal investigation for an unrelated issue, it discovered that it failed to implement its maintenance and testing program for eight of its 45 (17.8%) Special Protection System (SPS) devices that were incorporated into  three of its four remedial action schemes. Specifically, five of the SPS devices had a completed work order, but were missing the associated test record for either the last or prior maintenance activities.  One SPS device had no work order and was missing a test record for the prior maintenance activity.  The remaining two SPS devices had never been maintained or tested in accordance with PNM’s maintenance and testing program.

After reviewing all relevant information, WECC determined that PNM failed to implement its SPS maintenance and testing program for eight SPS devices, as required by PRC-017-0 R1.

The root cause of the noncompliance was due to management guidance or expectations not being well-defined, understood, or enforced.  Specifically, PNM management did not require that a formal process be in place to ensure test records for each maintenance activity were uploaded upon completion of the maintenance and testing task, which resulted in gaps in the records of PNM’s maintenance and testing activities.

",PRC-017-0,R1,High,Lower,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the BPS. PNM failed to implement its SPS maintenance and testing program for eight SPS devices, as required by PRC-017-0 R1. Such failure could potentially result in degradation of equipment, or cause a misoperation to occur that could result in unforeseen load shedding, or prevent planned load shedding from occurring. The potential impact to the BPS resulting from failure to either test or maintain PNM’s SPS would be that the devices in the scheme would not operate properly when the system experiences sustained low voltages in the local area where the UVLS is installed.  In this case, there is no increased risk of impact to the broader BES as the low voltage conditions would not propagate beyond the local area for failure of either one of these schemes. Therefore, WECC assessed the potential harm to the security and reliability of the BPS as minor. 

There was no actual impact to the BPS as the Import Contingency Load Shedding Scheme (ICLSS) SPS correctly initiated during a Category 1a event on August 7, 2016.  Further, the ICLSS successfully passed a full functional test of the SPS scheme following the August 7, 2016 event.  There was no actual impact to the two other SPS schemes in scope as there has been no known operation or failure to operate. Two of PNM's neighboring Transmission Owners/Operators also have UVLS schemes to address low voltages in the affected area and the likelihood of these adjacent schemes failing simultaneously with PNM's ICLSS scheme is low. Additionally, the SPS scheme is comprised of a central logic controller and multiple UVLS relays. The central logic controller was tested and maintained. The UVLS relays detect local voltage but can only operate if an enabling signal is sent from the central logic controller. As a result, the relays were treated as part of the SPS scheme instead of UVLS which keys off of only local voltage. The SPS is designed to arm more load for shedding than is necessary to mitigate the system conditions for which the scheme was designed.  Therefore, failure of one or more of the devices was unlikely to reduce the overall effectiveness of the scheme. The ICLSS SPS devices take independent actions, meaning that failure of one relay or other protection system component in the SPS would not have an impact on operation of any of the other devices in the system. Lastly, PNM’s system operators were trained and authorized to immediately shed firm load as necessary to address any system condition that threatened the reliability of the BPS.

","During a Compliance Audit conducted from October 7, 2013 through October 11, 2013, WECC determined that BPA, as a Balancing Authority (BA) and Transmission Operator (TOP), was in violation of PER-005-1 R1 and R2.

Specifically, during the off-site audit, BPA provided WECC its BES company-specific reliability-related tasks (Task List) performed by its System Operators. The list identified four System Operator positions and a list of specific tasks for each position. BPA also referenced a Job Task Analysis performed by a third party in 2007 as the basis for identifying the tasks performed by the System Operators to create its Task List of 213 possible tasks. During the on-site audit, BPA also supplied its reliability-related task definition: “A task that is required to be performed correctly to avoid frequency or voltage related instability, unplanned tripping of load, or uncontrolled separation or cascading outages affecting widespread area of the Interconnection.” BPA had filtered the third-party analysis list through its definition of a reliability-related task and arrived at the 32 tasks it believed to be reliability-related. Based on this definition and paired with the BPA-provided Task List, as well as System Operator interviews, WECC determined that not all BPA reliability-related tasks performed by the System Operators had been identified on its Task List. Through further analysis, WECC identified the specific tasks on the third-party analysis list that should have been on BPA’s Task List as being BPA company-specific, reliability-related tasks performed by System Operators.

While the Standard allows an entity to perform the analysis and create the list of tasks, the only specified qualifier is that the process must be consistent with a systematic approach to training. However, WECC determined that the very large discrepancy between the tasks identified by the third-party in combination with those identified by WECC indicated that BPA’s Task List was severely deficient. In addition, because the BPA Task List excluded key and critical system operator tasks, it did not meet the threshold of being an acceptable, comprehensive list of tasks performed by its System Operators in accordance with the Standard. Additionally, while WECC was able to verify BPA's historical practice of delivering training that goes beyond the tasks identified, there was not a Task List equivalent review and evaluation performed to ensure the Task List was up to date and comprehensive.  Lastly, WECC determined that because BPA did not produce a sufficient Task List, it was impossible to verify that each System Operator was capable of performing each assigned task which was yet to be identified on the Task List, new tasks assigned to each operator type, or modified tasks on the Task List. 

Therefore, after reviewing all relevant information, WECC determined that BPA failed to create a sufficient list of BES company-specific reliability-related tasks performed by its System Operators as required by PER-005-1 R1.1, which led to the failure to verify each of its System Operator’s capabilities to perform each assigned task identified in R1.1 at least one time as required by PER-005-1 R2.

The root cause of this noncompliance was a lack of understanding of the Requirement. Specifically, BPA did not make the connection between identifying which tasks were considered reliability-related, the tasks that were actually performed, and creating a systemic approach to System Operator training.
",PER-005-1 ,R1; R1.1,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious and substantial risk to the reliability of the Bulk Power System (BPS).  In these instances, BPA failed to create a sufficient list of BES company-specific reliability-related tasks performed by its System Operators as required by PER-005-1 R1.1, which led to the failure to verify each of its System Operator’s capabilities to perform each assigned task identified in R1.1 at least one time as required by PER-005-1 R2. Such failures could result in the inability for BPA to ensure that its System Operators were competent to perform real-time, BES reliability-related tasks potentially resulting in BES equipment damage, sustained outages, loss of load, loss of visibility, and increase system restoration time, or cause a burden on neighboring and interconnected entities.

As a BA and TOP, BPA’s transmission system covers 300,000 square miles in the Pacific Northwest and adjoining areas. The system includes approximately 15,000 transmission circuit miles and more than 200 substations. Bulk power operating voltages are 1000 kV DC, 500 kV, 345 kV, 287 kV, 230 kV, 161 kV, 138 kV, 115 kV. Ninety percent of the transmission system is at 500 kV, 230 kV, and 115 kV voltage levels.

","During a Compliance Audit conducted from October 7, 2013 through October 11, 2013, WECC determined that BPA, as a Balancing Authority (BA) and Transmission Operator (TOP), was in violation of PER-005-1 R1 and R2.

Specifically, during the off-site audit, BPA provided WECC its BES company-specific reliability-related tasks (Task List) performed by its System Operators. The list identified four System Operator positions and a list of specific tasks for each position. BPA also referenced a Job Task Analysis performed by a third party in 2007 as the basis for identifying the tasks performed by the System Operators to create its Task List of 213 possible tasks. During the on-site audit, BPA also supplied its reliability-related task definition: “A task that is required to be performed correctly to avoid frequency or voltage related instability, unplanned tripping of load, or uncontrolled separation or cascading outages affecting widespread area of the Interconnection.” BPA had filtered the third-party analysis list through its definition of a reliability-related task and arrived at the 32 tasks they believed to be reliability-related. Based on this definition and paired with the BPA provided Task List, as well as System Operator interviews, WECC determined that not all BPA reliability-related tasks performed by the System Operators had been identified on its Task List. Through further analysis, WECC identified the specific tasks on the third-party analysis list that should have been on BPA’s Task List as being BPA company-specific, reliability-related tasks performed by System Operators.

","During a Compliance Audit conducted from October 7, 2013 through October 11, 2013, WECC determined that BPA, as a Transmission Operator (TOP), was in violation of PRC-001-1 R3.

Specifically, WECC determined that BPA made 633 protective system changes during the audit period. However, BPA was not able to produce evidence that showed that it coordinated all 633 changes with neighboring BAs and TOPs. There was evidence that BPA coordinated only three of 29 protective system changes as part of the audit sample. When WECC asked for an explanation in a data request, BPA stated, ""Most of the new or changed protection systems listed are for lines or equipment that do not require coordination with neighboring TOPs or BAs because there is no effect on their protection, so no coordination was made, and no evidence is available."" 

Therefore, after reviewing all relevant information, WECC determined that BPA failed to coordinate all new protective systems and all protective system changes with neighboring Transmission Operators and Balancing Authorities as required by PRC-001-1 R3.

The root cause of this noncompliance was a misinterpretation of the Standard and Requirement. Specifically, BPA thought that it had to coordinate protective system changes with neighboring TOPs and BAs only when the changes affected the neighboring TOPs and BAs.",PRC-001-1,R3; R3.2,High,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the Bulk Power System (BPS). In this instance, BPA failed to coordinate all new protective systems and all protective system changes with neighboring TOPs and BAs as required by PRC-001-1 R3. This coordination allows GOPs, TOPs, and neighboring TOPs and BAs to be familiar with protective schemes applied in their areas that can have significant impacts on the reliability of the BES. If this coordination is not performed, it can contribute to uncontrolled outages, separations, and delay restorations following valid protective system actuations.

"Northeast Power Coordinating Council, Inc. (NPCC)",Unidentified Registered Entity 1 (NPCC_URE1),NCRXXXXX,NPCC2017017596,Settlement Agreement,"NPCC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report stating that it had three instances of noncompliance with CIP-006-6 R1.

As part of NPCC_URE1’s NERC Reliability Standards compliance program, a compliance concern was submitted by NPCC_URE1 staff and in accordance with NPCC_URE1’s procedures, an internal investigation was conducted of the reported incident that revealed a potential noncompliance.  

The violation started when NPCC_URE1 failed to follow its NERC CIP Physical Security Plan to restrict physical access, monitor and issue an alarm or alert to personnel identified in its Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber Security response plan within 15 minutes of detecting unauthorized physical access to one (1) Physical Access Control System (PACS). As a result, there was potential unauthorized access to one (1) PACS for multiple periods of time due to the failure to meet Parts 1.6, and 1.7 of CIP-006-6 R1.

Specifically, a room door was propped open for approximately 1 hour and 54 minutes. The timeline is as follows:
• 0623: Technician #1 with authorized access enters the room
• 0624: PACS generated a propped door alarm
• 0628: Security Guard acknowledged propped door alarm and cleared from system
• 0815: Security Guard noticed door was open on video camera monitoring system and notified security manager
• 0818: Security Guard secured the door

In another instance, a room door latch was disabled for approximately 7 hours and 38 minutes.  During that time, there were seven (7) forced door alarms generated by the PACS signaling the detection of potential unauthorized physical access (entry/exit without the use of the card reader). Security failed to monitor the alarms and notify a member of the incident response team within 15 minutes of detecting unauthorized access. The timeline is as follows:
• 0858: Technician #2 with authorized access disabled lock by stuffing material into the communications’ room door lock strike plate, which inhibited the door latch from engaging. 
• 0858 – 1636: Seven (7) forced door alarms were generated by the PACS, signaling the detection of physical entry without the use of the card reader (potential unauthorized access). Security did not respond as required by NPCC_URE1 procedure and failed to notify a member of the incident response team within 15 minutes of detecting unauthorized access.
• 1636: Security Guard discovered the disabled latch during a regular patrol and returned the latch to proper service.   

In another instance, the room door was propped open for approximately 3 hours and 7 minutes.  The timeline is as follows:
• 0802 – 0845: Five (5) Technicians with authorized access entered the room 
• 0845: PACS generated a propped door alarm. The Security Guard acknowledged the propped door alarm, and began to investigate via the CCTV system and site intrusion detection system.  The Security Guard cleared the alarm.  
• 1152: Security Guard who was dispatched to investigate found the propped door and secured it. The Security Guard spoke with a NPCC_URE1 electrician (who has authorized unescorted physical access) in the room. The electrician stated that the door was propped open when he arrived and no one else was in the room.

The root cause is lack of awareness and failure to follow documented procedures.  In the three instances, NPCC_URE1 Technicians violated the documented NERC CIP Physical Security Plan, NPCC_URE1 Security failed to monitor for unauthorized access to a PACS, and NPCC_URE1 Security failed to issue an alarm or alert in response to detected unauthorized physical access to a PACS.  
",CIP-006-6,R1: P1.6; P1.7,Medium,Severe,"The violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system. 

The PACS network switch within the room permits network communication between card reader control panels and the various PACS servers.  It could have been physically damaged or taken out of service by not following the proper access process and/or failing to respond to unauthorized access.  If this PACS network switch became unavailable, the primary security monitoring workstation location would be unable to communicate with the PACS server/PSP related card panels. However, all panels would continue to be operational using the last known configuration and an alternate PACS monitoring workstation would provide the monitoring capability.  The PACS network switch is not in the direct communications path between the PSP related card panels, PACS servers and the alternate PACS monitoring workstation.

The entity reduced the risk of a malicious attacker causing harm to the exposed PACS’ core network switch by implementing a defense-in-depth security strategy. 

The PACS core network switch has no graphical user interface and only provides administrative access through a physical console connection and has its unused physical ports disabled.  It also has a secure shell configuration requiring appropriate log-in credentials that are maintained as per NERC CIP requirements. 

The PACS core network switch is located behind three separate restricted physical access control points, which include a perimeter intrusion detection system, vehicle barriers, and CCTV cameras.  Security systems are monitored 24x7 by onsite security personnel.  Card readers are used to enter the perimeter and the building containing the room at issue.  All personnel who can facilitate their own access through the permiter and building must have a valid Personnel Risk Assessment (PRA).  All others entering this area are accompanied by personnel having access rights.  

No other CIP assets are located in the room.

During the first two incidents, approximately 30 persons carded into the building.  Of those 30, only three (3) did not have access to the room.  All three (3) have valid PRAs.

During the third incident, approximately 13 persons carded into the building.  Of those 13, only four (4) did not have access to the room.  All four (4) have valid PRAs, with three (3) having authorized access to other NPCC_URE1 PSPs.

NPCC_URE1 performed an investigation and found no evidence of any physical tampering with or unauthorized electronic access attempts during the timeframe of the incidents. Had an unauthorized person been successful in physically disabling the switch, the PACS would have sent communications failure messages to NPCC_URE1’s operations center and security.  No harm is known to have occurred.","The date the entity failed to follow its NERC CIP Physical Security Plan to restrict physical access, monitor and issue an alarm or alert to personnel identified in its BES Cyber Security response plan within 15 minutes of detecting unauthorized physical access to one PACS. ","The date the entity resumed following its NERC CIP Physical Security Plan to restrict physical access, monitor and issue an alarm or alert to personnel identified in its BES Cyber Security response plan within 15 minutes of detecting unauthorized physical access to one PACS. ",$0 ,Self-Report,"To mitigate this violation, NPCC_URE1:

1) Management conducted an ‘on the job briefing’ with technicians to reinforce the importance of maintaining physical security; 
2) Security conducted refresher training with security management staff to reinforce physical security policies and procedures, including physical access controls; 
3) Compliance department referred this matter to NPCC_URE1’s labor and law department for employee disciplinary consideration for staff involved in incidents; 
4) Security identified and implemented system improvements for forced and propped door alarm notifications and response to unauthorized access to PSPs, specifically, Security worked with an outside vendor to create a PDF window pop-up with specific instructions on when and how to respond to an alarm to help the operator to detect, assess, and respond to alarms;
5) Security and compliance conducted a presentation of physical security policies and procedures during an all-hands meeting; 
6) Security implemented new signage for all PSPs at NPCC_URE1’s BES facilities to include language related to adherence to NPCC_URE1’s physical security procedures;
7) Physical Infrastructure Security increased CCTV recording retention capabilities at all NPCC_URE1 BES facilities; and 
8) Physical Infrastructure Security implemented a system for forced and propped door alarm notifications and response to unauthorized access.
",12/19/2017,6/25/2018,Does Not Contest,"NPCC reviewed NPCC_URE1’s internal compliance program (ICP) and considered it to be a mitigating factor in the penalty determination.   NPCC_URE1 self-reported this particular potential non-compliance and continued to be highly cooperative throughout the entire process.

Although the violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system, NPCC determined that Compliance Exception treatment was not appropriate here based on the underlying conduct, which included deliberate and repetitive actions to prop open a door and/or disable locks in violation of the NPCC_URE1 procedure.

(FRCC)","Homestead, City of (HST)",NCR00037,FRCC2016015952,Settlement Agreement,"On July 27, 2016, HST submitted a Self-Report stating that, as a Balancing Authority (BA), it was in violation of BAL-001-2 R2.  

The violation started on July 1, 2016, when HST exceeded the BA Area Control Error (ACE) Limit (BAAL) high limit for 5 consecutive minutes (5 minutes beyond the 30 minutes allowed by the Requirement). The noncompliance ended when system conditions changed bringing HST’s ACE back to within the required limits.

On July 1, 2016, a storm hit the HST area causing a drop in load.  At 18:32 HST was allowing up to 14 MWs to flow into the Interconnection at a time when the Interconnection frequency was above 60 Hz. The 14 MWs is outside of HST's BAAL. 

In preparation for BAL-001-2 becoming effective on July 1, 2016, HST created BAAL alarms that come in at five (5) minute intervals while either the BAAL high or low limit is exceeded. The alarms were not enabled on July 1, 2016 and have since been activated.

During the first instance, since HST had less than four (4) MWs of generation on line, the only way to mitigate the situation within 30 minutes was to curtail an Interchange transaction. The System Operator (SO) cut the Interchange schedule for the next hour, and the BAAL high limit exceedance cleared at 19:07. 

During HST's extent of condition review, HST determined there had been a second instance. At 06:15 on July 22, 2016, the BAAL high five minute alarm came in due to over-scheduling of Interchange. The SO did not curtail any transactions but merely adjusted the next hour schedule lower. The BAAL high limit exceedance cleared at 07:02, after a total of 52 minutes. HST was in violation for 22 minutes.

The causes of this violation were determined to be: 1) insufficient training prior to the standard becoming enforceable 2) SO lack of understanding of how to properly cut and/or curtail a schedule and 3) alarms not being active on the effective date. ",BAL-001-2,R2.,Medium,Moderate,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS). 

The risk to the BPS is that HST could operate outside of the NERC-established limits for ACE, thus exacerbating possible frequency excursions. The loss of load due to storms or outages could trigger the BAAL high alarm depending on the system frequency and the amount of load lost. The loss of a generating resource could trigger the BAAL low alarm depending on the system frequency and the amount of generation lost. 

However, there is minimal risk to the BPS if HST exceeds the BAAL high frequency trigger due to the relatively small size of HST's 107 MW system, which equals 0.2% of the FRCC summer load.

As of April 6, 2016, HST had not implemented the updated Frequency Bias Setting (FBS) into its Area Control Error (ACE) calculation during the implementation period specified by the ERO (values to be updated by April 5, 2016 as specified in the BAL-003-1 FBS and L10 Values for 2016).  HST did not implement the correct FBS until February 27, 2017.

HST discovered the error on August 25, 2016 and attempted to change the FBS from -1.0 to -0.45, however EMS would not allow a setting above -1.0. Making the correct adjustment required working with the Energy Management System (EMS) vendor, and the FBS was updated to -0.50 due to system restriction.

The root cause for this violation was the failure of the Senior Load Dispatcher to understand that both the frequency response and the L10 values should be validated and if necessary change one or both, and then validate.",BAL-003-1.1,R2.,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS). 

By not implementing the correct frequency bias settings into the ACE equation, HST would not provide its appropriate share of the Frequency Response needed to maintain Interconnection Frequency within predefined bounds by arresting frequency deviations and supporting frequency. 

The risk was increased as the FBS was incorrect for 328 days.  

The risk was reduced due to HST's FBS changing from 7.47 (FBS = -0.75 Mw/0.1Hz) to 4.58 (FBS= -0.45/0.1Hz); therefore by not updating the HST FBS, it created an over-biased impact as a Balancing Authority where HST was contributing more than required to arrest frequency deviations.

The issue started on October 1, 2015, the effective date of the Standard, as nine of HST’s 11 underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) relays were not set in accordance with the FRCC UFLS program, and ended on March 15, 2017 when the re-calibration was complete.

The UFLS relays had Time Delays that allowed greater than the required 0.28 seconds, which would exceed the maximum timing requirement criteria (Time Delay = Intentional Delay + Relay Delay + Breaker Delay) defined in the FRCC UFLS program. The technician did not include the Breaker Delay in the Time Delay calculation and used a +/- 3% of 0.28 which resulted in a Time Delay greater than 0.28 seconds.  This was demonstrated by their test records, which showed the nine relays operated with an opening time of greater than 0.28 seconds.

The risk is that during a UFLS event, the UFLS load shedding on the HST system would have been slower to operate than was designed and planned for by the Planning Coordinator (FRCC), which could have allowed an increased frequency decay by not shedding all the load properly.

The risk was reduced because the HST UFLS program included the correct amount of load (40 MWs), in accordance with the FRCC UFLS program. Of the nine relays that were set incorrectly, the slowest reaction time before a relay would have activated was 0.03 seconds late.

Peak did not develop documented communication protocols for its operating personnel that issue Operating Instructions as required by R1. Although documented protocols existed in various versions and revisions, instances of noncompliance remained until Version 11 became effective. Specifically, Version 9 and Version 10 of Peak’s documented communication protocols failed to specify: (1) that operators should take an alternate action if a response is not received or if the Operating Instruction was not understood by the receiver in accordance with part 1.2; and (2) the format for time identification in accordance with part 1.5. Version 9 of Peak’s communication protocols went into effect on July 1, 2016. Version 11 of Peak’s documented communication protocols, which became effective on April 24, 2017, included all components of three-part communication identified in part 1.2 and clarified the format for time identification in accordance with part 1.5.

The cause of this violation was that Peak incorrectly relied on a technical justification document written by the COM-002-4 standard drafting team, when the draft was posted for comment, in deciding to instruct its operating personnel to continue issuing directives as a type of Operating Instruction. Peak also inaccurately placed inordinate emphasis on the word “command” in the definition of Operating Instruction as related to its daily operating communications and, thus, failed to apply all of the R1 protocols to its oral, person-to-person, Operating Instructions.",COM-002-4,R1,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS).

Throughout the duration of this violation, Peak’s operating personnel utilized communications that did not meet the minimum set of protocols that must be included in documented communication protocols. This increased the possibility of miscommunication that could lead to action or inaction harmful to the reliability of the BPS. However, this risk was mitigated here based on the following factors. Peak's documented communication protocols in effect throughout the time of the issue specified that three-part communication was to be used when issuing or receiving Operating Instructions and when issuing Reliability Directives. So, while Peak's documented communication protocols did not specify that an alternative action was to be taken if the communication was not understood or not received, they did specify that the RC System Operator should reissue the communication until the information was repeated back correctly. Accordingly, the issuer would be aware that the Operating Instruction or Reliability Directive was not received or understood.

System Operators responsible for the Real-time operation of the interconnected bulk power system (BPS) at Peak issued Operating Instructions, including during an Emergency, prior to being trained on the documented communications protocols developed in R1. 

The documented communication protocols developed for COM-002-4 R1, Version 9, had not been released at the time the training course ID “PEAKRC_009_Operating_Instructions_and_Reliability_Directives” was developed and implemented.  As such, the training focused on the COM-002-4 Standard and Requirements and Version 8 of Peak's documented communication protocols.

",COM-002-4,R2,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the BPS based on the following factors. Peak's operating personnel's failure to utilize communications that did not comport with the required minimum set of protocols increased the possibility of miscommunication that could (1) lead to action or inaction harmful to the reliability of the BPS, and (2) lead to confusion with external entities with whom they communicated. However, this risk was mitigated here based on the following factors. First, Peak provided training course ID ""PEAKRC_009_Operating_Instructions_and_Reliability_Directives"" to all of its System Operators prior to the effective date of COM-002-4 or prior to them issuing an Operating Instruction. Second, while the ""PEAKRC_009_Operating_Instructions_and_Reliability_Directives"" training course focused on Version 8 of the documented protocols, it did include a review of COM-002-4, the NERC definition of Operating Instruction, and Version 9 of the documented communication protocols, which were not yet effective but were specifically developed for COM-002-4 R1.

",NCEA201717866,Settlement Agreement,"During a Spot Check conducted from May 23, 2017 through May 24, 2017, NERC determined that Peak, as a Reliability Coordinator (RC), violated PER-005-2 R1.

Peak failed to apply the systematic approach to training to identify the change in expectations for the RC System Operators based on the new definition of Operating Instruction and COM-002-4 and, thus, provide training to the System Operators accordingly.

Peak has a documented process to determine if a new Reliability Related Task (RRT) needs to be created or if a modification to an existing RRT is warranted. However, Peak did not recognize changes to the competency needed to perform its company-specific RRTs based on changes to COM-002-4 and the suite of revisions to TOP/IRO standards applicable to the RC.

The risk was aggravated because Peak’s protocols and training focused on Reliability Directives, but did not provide guidance or training to System Operators on using Operating Instructions which, unlike Reliability Directives, are not limited to being used during Emergencies or Adverse Reliability Impacts. This could result in RC System Operators not being aware of the ability to issue or not issuing an Operating Instruction to proactively maintain reliability in situations that are not Emergencies. However, this risk was mitigated by the following factors. First, Peak had communication protocols that mandated three-part communication for all Operating Instructions, including Reliability Directives. Second, Peak provided the System Operators training on Reliability Directives and using the communication protocols, including three-part communication. No harm is known to have occurred.

However, NERC decided to file them in combination as a Spreadsheet Notice of Penalty as the violations resulted in a more moderate risk exposure overall.  

Peak has one prior instance of noncompliance with PER-005-1 R1.  The prior violation is distinguishable from the instant violation because the prior violation arose from Peak’s failure to have an established process for making changes to the training program.

","WECC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-6 R2 Parts 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.  

Specifically, WECC_URE1 reported that it was instructed by the designer, manufacturer, and warranty provider of the high voltage direct current protection and control system (HVDC PCS) at a substation, that its patches and updates for software and firmware provided during the warranty period would be functional patches rather than security patches and only for the designer's proprietary devices. The designer's position was that because the substation Station Control and Monitoring (SCM) network for the HVDC PCS was a private network with no External Routable Connectivity (ERC), it did not perform security patching because of the potential to disrupt operations. Due to a setting in a single device being incorrect, the SCM network suffered a failure during the trial operation phase. The designer's position was not to apply security patches to the system devices because those security patches could pose a risk to system reliability without providing a tangible security benefit. As a term of purchase, the designer had approving authority for implementation of patches for third-party manufactured devices that were utilized by the designer in the system design. Because of this agreement between WECC_URE1 and the designer, the responsibility of evaluating security patches for the third-party devices and Operating System platforms had yet to be defined.   

The HVDC PCS at the substation was an engineered high speed, real time, closed loop, protection and control system. This engineered system consists of multiple devices running multiple software packages that are closely integrated by the manufacturer, to meet the protection and control requirements. The manufacturer and designer sold the engineered system to WECC_URE1 and retained the knowledge of how the software and hardware integrations work. As required by CIP-007-6 R2 Part 2.1, WECC_URE1  had identified the manufacturer as the patch source for the HVDC PCS at the substation.  However, since the manufacturer does not have a website with patching information for the HVDC PCS, it was required to notify WECC_URE1 when new security patches were available.  The evaluation of security patches for the BES Cyber Assets (BCAs) and Protected Cyber Assets (PCAs) at the substation and the creation of mitigation plan(s), had not taken place since the requirement became effective on July 1, 2016 as required by CIP-007-6 R2 Parts 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.

Additionally, WECC_URE1 was performing its CIP-007-6 R2 security patch management program for the other CIP devices by different manufacturers within this substation.  This violation was discovered during WECC_URE1’s preparation for a WECC audit. 

WECC determined that WECC_URE1 failed to implement a program or process for tracking (2.1), evaluating (2.2), and installing cyber security patches or creating a mitigation plan to address the vulnerabilities addressed by each security patch that was not installed (2.3) and implementing the mitigation plan (2.4) for its designer devices at its substation, designated as a Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems (MIBCS), consisting of BCAs and PCAs.

WECC determined that this violation began when the Standard and Requirement became mandatory and enforceable for WECC_URE1, and ended when WECC_URE1 implemented a security patch management program for the designer's devices in its MIBCS located at its substation, for a total of 502 days of noncompliance.

The root cause of this violation was WECC_URE1's not integrating the substation HVDC PCS into the field patch management process. Specifically, WECC_URE1 underestimated the resources needed and effort required to establish and operate a compliant security patch management program at its substation.
",CIP-007-6,"R2; P2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4",High,Severe,"WECC determined this noncompliance posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the Bulk Power System.  In this instance, WECC_URE1 failed to implement or document a security patch management program for its manufacturer's devices within its MIBCS consisting of BCAs and PCAs, located at the substation, as required by CIP-007-6 R2. Such failure could potentially result in unauthorized electronic access to the vulnerable systems within WECC_URE1's substations. Unauthorized electronic access, due to unpatched software, could result in complete control of the unpatched devices due to malware infection or other successful intrusion into the network locations of the unpatched systems. The result could be complete control (installation of software, exfiltration of data, remote control, etc.) of the affected system and an anchor point for reconnaissance and spreading through the environment, which could result in significant negative effects to the BPS, including neighboring entities via interties.  The substation monitors and controls a WECC major path.

However, the substation has no ERC to the substation; therefore, any compromise would have to be performed at the physical site itself. WECC_URE1 implemented weak controls to detect this violation.  Vendor-approved security patches are applied on an annual basis for vendor-owned CIP assets.  All other CIP assets are managed under WECC_URE1's security patch management program. Based on this, WECC determined that the potential harm had a moderate likelihood of occurring.   ",when the Standard and Requirement became mandatory and enforceable,when a security patch management program was implemented for the devices in scope,No penalty,Self-Report,"To mitigate this violation, WECC_URE1:  

1) enrolled the BCAs and PCAs at the substation into its firmware tracker;
2) utilized its existing patch mitigation plan process to document all designer-released security patches that needed to be deployed to the devices in scope; and
3) documented changes to the baseline for firmware or software as a result of deploying patches during a maintenance outage.

","WECC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report stating that it was in violation of CIP-005-1 R2.4.  

Specifically, WECC_URE1 reported that during a routine audit, it was discovered one Cyber Asset at a substation with External Routable Connectivity (ERC) containing Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems (MIBCS) that allowed access to a relay without any authentication procedure.  The investigation showed that the device had been set to allow access without a password.  Because this violated the approved configuration for these devices, technical services issued an inspection of all in-service devices to review and correct any devices which were not set up correctly (remote authentication enabled and all ports set to require authentication).  WECC_URE1 determined there were no additional devices configuration issues. The improperly configured device had one port where the access control default was not changed to require a password. This setting was changed on the day it was found. This setting change is required in the configuration manual utilized by WECC_URE1 . The manual was also reviewed and additional language was added to reinforce the requirement to enable passwords.

WECC determined that WECC_URE1 failed to implement strong procedural or technical access controls at the access point of an Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) to ensure authenticity of the accessing party for one device that allowed access to a relay.

The root cause of this violation was the accuracy or effectiveness of changes were not verified or validated.  Specifically, the configuration of the device was never completely validated to ensure accuracy.
",CIP-005-1,R2; R2.4,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the BPS.  In this instance, WECC_URE1 failed to ensure authentication at the device access point for all user access into WECC_URE1’s substation containing MIBCS as required by CIP-005-1 R2.4.  Such failure could result in inappropriate access via a compromised or misused remote access account resulting in significant negative effects on the reliability and stability of the Bulk Electric System (BES), including but not limited to disruption, manipulation, or compromise of the MIBCS for reconnaissance. 

WECC_URE1 implemented weak detective controls in that the issue was identified as a result of an  audit 8 years after the device should have been compliant with the CIP-005-1 R2.4.  However, access to device was limited to a small number of personnel who were authorized to have said access.  The improper setting allowed direct access to the device from WECC_URE1’s network  The network requires privileges and authentication to access.  This is a local WECC_URE1 network for supporting field BES Cyber Systems that does not have direct access to the Internet.  A detailed configuration review of devices revealed no additional misconfigurations.  Based on this, the potential harm had a minimal likelihood of occurring.

","WECC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R3.1.

Specifically, WECC_URE1 reported that in preparation an audit, WECC_URE1 determined that it was not able to confirm that it documented the assessment of security patches and security upgrades for applicability within 30 calendars days of the availability of the patches or upgrades for seven Critical Cyber Assets (CCAs).  The CCAs included two Remedial Action Schemes (RAS) within its Control Centers and five network servers.  During an internal investigation of this noncompliance, WECC_URE1 determined that after experiencing network connection issues, one of its technicians saved evidence of security patch assessment to his computer’s hard drive, which was subsequently wiped clean without saving a copy when the technician’s employment ended; resulting in a gap in security patch management documentation from.   

After reviewing all relevant information, WECC determined an increase of scope from the initial Self-Report.  During scheduled maintenance, WECC_URE1 performed a full investigation which identified 58 additional RAS system devices, and 6 RAS servers.  WECC_URE1 failed to document the assessment of security patches and security upgrades for applicability within 30 calendar days of the availability of the patches or upgrades for a total of 71 CCAs.

The root cause of the first device issue was the improper identification and classification of a device in the PACS systems.  The root cause of the network equipment issue was the poor transition of duties between personnel.  The root cause of the RAS system issue was the lack of written communication.  Specifically, a specific security patch fix was not documented on WECC_URE1’s patch discovery list.
",CIP-007-3a,R3,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the BPS.  In this instance, WECC_URE1 failed to document the assessment of security patches within 30 days for 71 CCAs. Such failure may lead to security exposures that could result in serious adverse effects on WECC_URE1’s operations, including the installation of potentially harmful software on the CCAs.  Installation of malware or other harmful software could lead to unintended access and eventually to control of systems and software.  Given that this violation involved several different locations containing the CCAs, a widespread coordinated attack would be conceivable.  As such, the failure to adequately protect devices and resources could affect the reliability of the BPS.

However, the controls implemented by WECC_URE1 reduced the likelihood of the potential harm from occurring.  Specifically, none of the network equipment has internet access and was secured in server rooms with limited authorized physical access.  Additionally, antivirus was maintained on all network applicable devices.  The RAS equipment does not have ERC and is also located in locked cabinets within Controls Centers, with alarming for access attempts.

Specifically, WECC_URE1 reported that as part of its reliability compliance monitoring efforts, during an internal spot check of visitor logs it discovered that an entry made on a specific date did not include a last exit time for one visitor as required by CIP-006-6 R2 Part 2.2.

WECC determined that WECC_URE1 failed to include all the required elements of CIP-006-6 R2 Part 2.2 specific to one visitor on its visitor log.

The root cause of this violation was due to a mental lapse that lead to an incorrect performance.  Specifically, the visitor escort was trained appropriately in the process; however, did not follow that process.

WECC determined that this violation began when WECC_URE1 did not fill in the last exit time on a visitor log, and ended when WECC_URE1 mitigated this violation, for a total of 372 days of noncompliance.
",CIP-006-6,R2; P2.2,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system.  In this instance, WECC_URE1 failed to include all the required elements of CIP-006-6 R2 Part 2.2 specific to one visitor on its visitor log. Such failure could lead to the visitor being allowed back in without knowledge; without justifiable cause; and potentially without a visitor escort. In addition, ensuring that visitors are logged out provides closure of the visitor management process and clarification that the individual is still not somewhere in the facility, which during an emergency could create an issue for security personnel attempting to locate the individual for safety concerns. 

However, WECC_URE1 implemented good preventive controls.  Specifically, WECC_URE1 maintained a visitor escort for the visitor while in the Physical Security Perimeter (PSP), and performed all required duties with the exception of ensuring final logout of the visitor.  The PSP which was protecting the control center was manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week by system operators and physical security personnel.  Additionally, cards issued to visitors must be turned back in to Security prior to final exit, and the cards do not actually open any access points; thereby, reducing the likelihood of re-entrance without an escort. WECC determined the potential harm had a remote likelihood of occurring.

During its annual review of baseline documentation conducted as part of the Cyber Vulnerability Assessment (CVA), the entity discovered that a service not required for normal or emergency operations was incorrectly enabled.  The main purpose of that service is to allow the sharing of an internet connection for devices using a modem over dial-up. The issue was identified on two devices during the execution of a CVA. An extent of condition review determined that the configurations were duplicated across several terminal servers. The systems at issue do not have modems and the entity has disabled dial-up access by default.  In fact, none of these devices have any internet access at all.

The root cause of this violation was the failure to properly review an incorrect justification for the service at issue, which was previously needed under a prior operating system.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 1 (RFC_URE1),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016015930,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R3.  During regular patch management quality assurance activities related to CIP Version 5 implementation, the entity discovered that security patch reviews for two server management devices were not conducted within 30 days of their release as required by CIP-007-3 R3.1 and entity procedures.   Several patches for two server management devices were not reviewed.  Additionally, these patches were neither installed nor were compensating measures applied as specified CIP-007-3 R3.2 and entity procedures.

After self-reporting this issue with the server management devices, the entity identified two additional patching issues that were also identified during the quality assurance review of the patch management program.  One related to antivirus patching, and the other involved the late assessment of patches for the operating system of Physical Access Control System (PACS) devices.

With respect to the antivirus patching issue, during the entity’s initial run of its new CIP Version 5 process for historical patch discovery, IT personnel identified that entity business units were running different version of the antivirus client installed in their respective environments.  Most of the devices containing the antivirus client had up-to-date versions of the client and did not pose a compliance issue.  However, the entity determined that about 5% of the devices had missed four antivirus client version upgrades, another 3% had missed three version upgrades, another 1% had missed two version upgrades, and the remaining 6% had missed one antivirus client version upgrade.  In total, there were four antivirus client patches involved.

With respect to the PACS patching issue, as part of the entity’s new patch management processes, an automatic Patch Source Review (PSR) is generated within the entity’s primary patch management system.  The patch management system receives patch source information, identifies relevant security patches for particular devices, and generates an automated Device Patch Notification (DPN) to each asset owner to trigger the patch assessment process in a timely manner.  During the early deployment of the patch management system, the entity discovered that due to a failure to correctly identify the devices in software/firmware libraries, DPNs were not generated for the operating system of multiple PACS devices for which patches were identified.  As a result of not receiving these DPNs, the relevant asset owners did not assess the applicability of several unique patches within the 30-day requirement.  However, the due diligence of the patch management system project team support by patch tracking tools and internal controls caught the error quickly, so that the patches in question were assessed 20 days late, and compensating measures were put into place.

The root causes of this violation are as follows:
a. With respect to the server management device issue, the names of the devices had not been correctly entered into the entity’s previous patch tracking systems.  As a result the prior patch tracking systems did not flag the devices for security patch management.  This problem was compounded by the device names also appearing incorrectly on other related tools, such as the central Shared Services Master Asset List, which hindered the detection of the error.
b. With respect to the antivirus issue, the major contributing factor was a lack of clarity and specificity in the entity’s CIP Version 3 patch management procedures.  Those procedures state that the responsible party for patch identification, assessment, and deployment is the asset owner.  The asset owner includes the operating system owner and the application owner.  This fact caused a difference of interpretation between business units as to who was performing the assessments and record keeping for patching the antivirus client.  Additionally, at the time of the violation, entry into the patch tool was a manual process which lacked clarity as to who would perform the entry.
c. With respect to the patch management system issue, the major contributing factor was the failure to correctly identify the devices in software/firmware libraries.

All of these root causes involve the management practice of asset and configuration management, which includes establishing assets and configuration items inventory, controlling changes, and verifying the integrity of such items.  
",CIP-007-3a,R3,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  First, with respect to the devices involved in the server management device and patch management system issues, those devices were protected by multiple network infrastructure layers with separate two factor authentication and do not directly affect Bulk Electric Systems.  Rather, they support backup and update functions of other systems.  Second, with respect to the antivirus issue, the fact that some of the software clients were running older versions of the application did not increase the risk of this noncompliance because newer versions of the software concern the addition of new features, not the library or index of malicious files that the application uses to identify malware.  In other words, the fact that some software clients were running older versions of the application did not affect the entity’s ability to identify and prevent malware because the library of threats was kept current.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 1 (RFC_URE1),NCRXXXXX,RFC2015014717,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R5.  Following an internal compliance review, the entity identified a single user account on its Energy Control System (ECS) that was not afforded sufficient password complexity controls in accordance with CIP-007 R5.3.1.  When the account in question was created, it was inadvertently configured to require a minimum password length of zero characters instead of the minimum eight characters that the entity’s own procedural controls require.  The eight character minimum is more stringent than the six character minimum requirement in CIP-007 R5.3.1.

The root cause of this violation was that the entity uses a phase review process to identify and remediate these types of issues.  In this case, the reviewing employee failed to identify this discrepancy and reset the technical control accordingly.  Upon discovering the discrepancy, the entity immediately changed the password length configuration from zero to eight characters.  This noncompliance involves the management practice of workforce management through ineffective training.

Following an internal compliance review, the entity identified certain accounts that were not afforded sufficient password change controls in accordance with CIP-007-3a R5.3.3.

Specifically, the entity discovered a local account on three assets within the Private Network (PN) managed by the entity’s IT infrastructure & operations group for which passwords were not changed at least annually. The required password changes were made on these three accounts 5 years after being put into production.

The root cause of this violation was the manual oversight performed in the account monitoring process, which resulted in IT infrastructure and operations not identifying the required password changed for these accounts.  This major contributing factor involves the management practice of asset and configuration management, which includes controlling changes to assets and configuration items and baselines.  ",CIP-007-3a,R5,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  The entity’s secure network architecture and its use of a defense-in-depth strategy to minimize the risk of unauthorized access helps minimize the risk posed by this violation.  Additionally, the entity utilizes redundant controls to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, including password complexity and length requirements.  Entity passwords must be at least eight characters in length.  The entity also has monitoring controls in place to alert the appropriate CIP asset owner when multiple failed logon attempts are made on a single asset.  For an outside intruder to exploit these accounts, that intruder would need to infiltrate several layers of firewalls or obtain physical access to a protected Physical Security Perimeter before that intruder could gain access to any of these three accounts.  Finally, the assets are in a separate demilitarized zone (DMZ), have a separate domain from the Electronic Security Perimeter devices, and have a limited number of administrators.  In each case, the account on the asset expired and was not used again.  If any user had attempted to access any of the accounts, that user would have been forced to change the password on the asset.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 2 (RFC_URE2),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016015933,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE2 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R3.  During regular patch management quality assurance activities related to CIP Version 5 implementation, the entity discovered that security patch reviews for two server management devices were not conducted within 30 days of their release as required by CIP-007-3 R3.1 and entity procedures.   Several patches for two server management devices were not reviewed.  Additionally, these patches were neither installed nor were compensating measures applied as specified CIP-007-3 R3.2 and entity procedures.

After self-reporting this issue with the server management devices, the entity identified two additional patching issues that were also identified during the quality assurance review of the patch management program.  One related to antivirus patching, and the other involved the late assessment of patches for the operating system of Physical Access Control System (PACS) devices.

With respect to the antivirus patching issue, during the entity’s initial run of its new CIP Version 5 process for historical patch discovery, IT personnel identified that entity business units were running different version of the antivirus client installed in their respective environments.  Most of the devices containing the antivirus client had up-to-date versions of the client and did not pose a compliance issue.  However, the entity determined that about 5% of the devices had missed four antivirus client version upgrades, another 3% had missed three version upgrades, another 1% had missed two version upgrades, and the remaining 6% had missed one antivirus client version upgrade.  In total, there were four antivirus client patches involved.

With respect to the PACS patching issue, as part of the entity’s new patch management processes, an automatic Patch Source Review (PSR) is generated within the entity’s primary patch management system.  The patch management system receives patch source information, identifies relevant security patches for particular devices, and generates an automated Device Patch Notification (DPN) to each asset owner to trigger the patch assessment process in a timely manner.  During the early deployment of the patch management system, the entity discovered that due to a failure to correctly identify the devices in software/firmware libraries, DPNs were not generated for the operating system of multiple PACS devices for which patches were identified.  As a result of not receiving these DPNs, the relevant asset owners did not assess the applicability of several unique patches within the 30-day requirement.  However, the due diligence of the patch management system project team support by patch tracking tools and internal controls caught the error quickly, so that the patches in question were assessed 20 days late, and compensating measures were put into place.

The root causes of this violation are as follows:
a. With respect to the server management device issue, the names of the devices had not been correctly entered into the entity’s previous patch tracking systems.  As a result the prior patch tracking systems did not flag the devices for security patch management.  This problem was compounded by the device names also appearing incorrectly on other related tools, such as the central Shared Services Master Asset List, which hindered the detection of the error.
b. With respect to the antivirus issue, the major contributing factor was a lack of clarity and specificity in the entity’s CIP Version 3 patch management procedures.  Those procedures state that the responsible party for patch identification, assessment, and deployment is the asset owner.  The asset owner includes the operating system owner and the application owner.  This fact caused a difference of interpretation between business units as to who was performing the assessments and record keeping for patching the antivirus client.  Additionally, at the time of the violation, entry into the patch tool was a manual process which lacked clarity as to who would perform the entry.
c. With respect to the patch management system issue, the major contributing factor was the failure to correctly identify the devices in software/firmware libraries.

All of these root causes involve the management practice of asset and configuration management, which includes establishing assets and configuration items inventory, controlling changes, and verifying the integrity of such items.  
",CIP-007-3a,R3,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  First, with respect to the devices involved in the server management device and patch management system issues, those devices were protected by multiple network infrastructure layers with separate two factor authentication and do not directly affect Bulk Electric Systems.  Rather, they support backup and update functions of other systems.  Second, with respect to the antivirus issue, the fact that some of the software clients were running older versions of the application did not increase the risk of this noncompliance because newer versions of the software concern the addition of new features, not the library or index of malicious files that the application uses to identify malware.  In other words, the fact that some software clients were running older versions of the application did not affect the entity’s ability to identify and prevent malware because the library of threats was kept current.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 2 (RFC_URE2),NCRXXXXX,RFC2015014719,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE2 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R6.  The entity identified instances in which certain Cyber Assets did not perform continuous monitoring and logging functions as required by CIP-007-3a R6.

As part of remediation efforts under a prior mitigation plan, the entity and the entity's corporate information security services team brought a number of Electronic Access Control and Monitoring Systems (EACMS) into CIP compliance including a class of firewall managers used to manage checkpoint firewalls.  All activity for these checkpoint firewalls are collected and logged to a security event management system either directly, or by way of the firewall managers.

The entity discovered that logs from the firewall managers were not consistently collected by the security event management system. Upon further investigation and discussion, the entity determined a software issue was the apparent cause for the logging issue.  Logs with larger file sizes interfered with the firewall agent’s ability to process such logs.

The root cause of this violation involves the management practice of verification.  The entity did not have an effective internal control in place to ensure that the firewall manager’s logs were consistently collected and logged as required by CIP-007-3a R6.  A technical issue with the security event management system software interfered with the firewall agent’s ability to process such logs.  This meant that all logs from the firewall manager were not consistently collected and logged by the security event management system.  This system was not able to resolve this technical issue and the entity found another software, which was able to process the larger file sizes that caused the problems.  ",CIP-007-3a,R6,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  The entity utilizes a defense-in-depth strategy that reduces the risk of unauthorized access attempts.  The entity monitors Electronic Security Perimeter access through active intrusion detection systems.  Access to Critical Cyber Assets (CCAs) requires the potential user to pass through multiple layers of firewalls before accessing the CCA.  These protections mean that changes to the configuration of a single firewall would not, on its own, provide access to an unauthorized user.  Aside from the logging issue, the firewall was functioning properly in that it was effectively controlling what can pass through the device.  Therefore, any changes to the configuration of a single firewall would not, on its own, provide access to an authorized user.  The entity also has other redundant controls in place such as required two-factor authentication and that serves as an alternative mechanism for logging, monitoring, and alerting via Remote Secure Access logs.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 2 (RFC_URE2),NCRXXXXX,RFC2017016759,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE2 submitted a Self-Report stating that it had an issue of CIP-007-6 R4.  The entity conducted an internal self-assessment of compliance with CIP-007-6 R4, including gathering evidence of reviewing a summary of logged events.  The entity discovered that for sample dates of the 1st and 15th of two months, the records associated with the summary reviews for certain firewalls at the entity were incomplete, meaning that the reviews were not completed properly.  Further review determined that stored security event logs had not been consistently reviewed, and, therefore, the reviews were not documented as required by the entity’s procedure and by CIP-007-6 R4, Part 4.4, which requires a review at intervals no greater than 15 calendar days to identify undetected Cyber Security Incidents.

The root cause of this noncompliance was an insufficient procedure for performing the reviews and a lack of quality control for verifying the completeness of the reviews.  First, the procedure failed to establish a backup performer for this activity.  The heavy and unbalanced workload for the employee responsible for performing the summary reviews prevented all reviews from being completed in a timely manner.  Second, the procedure for performing these reviews was unclear regarding which reports were required to be completed for the review.  Finally, the entity did not have adequate internal preventative controls in place to ensure that the reviews were completed in a timely manner.

During its annual review of baseline documentation conducted as part of the Cyber Vulnerability Assessment (CVA), the entity discovered that a service not required for normal or emergency operations was incorrectly enabled.  The main purpose of that service is to allow the sharing of an internet connection for devices using a modem over dial-up. The issue was identified on two devices during the execution of a CVA. An extent of condition review determined that the configurations were duplicated across several devices. The systems at issue do not have modems and the entity has disabled dial-up access by default.  In fact, none of these devices have any internet access at all.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 3 (RFC_URE3),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016015932,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE3 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R3.  During regular patch management quality assurance activities related to CIP Version 5 implementation, the entity discovered that security patch reviews for two server management devices were not conducted within 30 days of their release as required by CIP-007-3 R3.1 and entity procedures.   Several patches for two server management devices were not reviewed.  Additionally, these patches were neither installed nor were compensating measures applied as specified CIP-007-3 R3.2 and entity procedures.

After self-reporting this issue with the server management devices, the entity identified two additional patching issues that were also identified during the quality assurance review of the patch management program.  One related to antivirus patching, and the other involved the late assessment of patches for the operating system of Physical Access Control System (PACS) devices.

With respect to the antivirus patching issue, during the entity’s initial run of its new CIP Version 5 process for historical patch discovery, IT personnel identified that entity business units were running different version of the antivirus client installed in their respective environments.  Most of the devices containing the antivirus client had up-to-date versions of the client and did not pose a compliance issue.  However, the entity determined that about 5% of the devices had missed four antivirus client version upgrades, another 3% had missed three version upgrades, another 1% had missed two version upgrades, and the remaining 6% had missed one antivirus client version upgrade.  In total, there were four antivirus client patches involved.

With respect to the PACS patching issue, as part of the entity’s new patch management processes, an automatic Patch Source Review (PSR) is generated within the entity’s primary patch management system.  The patch management system receives patch source information, identifies relevant security patches for particular devices, and generates an automated Device Patch Notification (DPN) to each asset owner to trigger the patch assessment process in a timely manner.  During the early deployment of the patch management system, the entity discovered that due to a failure to correctly identify the devices in software/firmware libraries, DPNs were not generated for the operating system of multiple PACS devices for which patches were identified.  As a result of not receiving these DPNs, the relevant asset owners did not assess the applicability of several unique patches within the 30-day requirement.  However, the due diligence of the patch management system project team support by patch tracking tools and internal controls caught the error quickly, so that the patches in question were assessed 20 days late, and compensating measures were put into place.

The root causes of this violation are as follows:
a. With respect to the server management device issue, the names of the devices had not been correctly entered into the entity’s previous patch tracking systems.  As a result the prior patch tracking systems did not flag the devices for security patch management.  This problem was compounded by the device names also appearing incorrectly on other related tools, such as the central Shared Services Master Asset List, which hindered the detection of the error.
b. With respect to the antivirus issue, the major contributing factor was a lack of clarity and specificity in the entity’s CIP Version 3 patch management procedures.  Those procedures state that the responsible party for patch identification, assessment, and deployment is the asset owner.  The asset owner includes the operating system owner and the application owner.  This fact caused a difference of interpretation between business units as to who was performing the assessments and record keeping for patching the antivirus client.  Additionally, at the time of the violation, entry into the patch tool was a manual process which lacked clarity as to who would perform the entry.
c. With respect to the patch management system issue, the major contributing factor was the failure to correctly identify the devices in software/firmware libraries.

All of these root causes involve the management practice of asset and configuration management, which includes establishing assets and configuration items inventory, controlling changes, and verifying the integrity of such items.

In other words, the fact that some software clients were running older versions of the application did not affect the entity’s ability to identify and prevent malware because the library of threats was kept current.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 3 (RFC_URE3),NCRXXXXX,RFC2015015328,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE3 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R4.  During an internal log review process, the entity discovered an instance where an antivirus definitions package was not tested on like devices prior to its installation in the production environment as required by the entity’s NERC CIP Malicious Software Prevention Procedure. That procedure requires the testing of definition signature packages performed on development assets prior to the testing of the corresponding production assets.  The lack of testing involved the entity's generation control system.  For the assets at issue, there are four groups: Development Workstations, Development Servers, Production Workstations, and Production Servers.

The log review revealed that corporate securty services inadvertently installed an antivirus definitions package on the generation control system development servers in the east Private Network (PN) for testing rather than the appropriate definition package.  This occurred at the same time the appropriate definition package was installed on the generation control system development workstations.  An employee inadvertently selected the wrong definitions package from the drop down tool to push to the development servers.  The tool requires users to manually select the correct package for definition updates.  This lack of attention to detail caused the wrong definitions package to be pushed to the development server group.  During the testing period, the entity observed no impacts on any assets.

Virus signatures are deployed to Development Assets with the current day’s virus signature. The signatures are tested for a week and then are applied to the Production Environment following testing. The policy for the virus signatures has to be changed manually and this requirement leaves it open to human error.  The entity’s analyst picked the current date’s signatures for application to Development Assets and then accidently picked the same package for the Production Assets instead of picking the package that had been tested the week before.  An internal log review confirmed that a subsequent definition push was successfully accomplished which brought all definitions up to the current, tested sequence number.

This noncompliance involves the management practice of verification.  In this noncompliance, an entity analyst inadvertently picked the wrong set of virus signatures to apply to Production Assets.  The root cause was that the entity did not have an effective process in place to ensure that these types of human errors were corrected before any impact came from them.  A contributing cause of this noncompliance was a lack of an effective verification process.  ",CIP-007-3a,R4,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS) based on the following factors.  The risk is minimal because the entity had tested all of the signatures performed on the generation control system Development Workstations before deploying the signatures to the production system.  The devices received the most current virus definition files that were tested within the entity.  The files had just not been tested on like devices prior to deployment.   Corporate security services monitors and has visibility into the production environment to determine if there were any adverse impacts to the development workstation from the deployment of incorrect virus signatures as part of the entity’s standard operating process.  The entity witnessed no impact to the production environment.  There was no performance or functional impact to the assets during the one week the package was in place to either the generation control system server assets, the generation control system, or the BPS.  Lastly, the incorrect package of signatures was in place for a short amount of time: only one week.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 3 (RFC_URE3),NCRXXXXX,RFC2015014720,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE3 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R5.  Following an internal compliance review, the entity identified certain accounts that were not afforded sufficient password change controls in accordance with CIP-007 R5.3.3.  Specifically, the entity discovered five accounts in which passwords for certain accounts were not changed at least annually.  For four of these accounts, existing controls required the account user to change the account password every 90 days per entity procedures.  However, users that did not log on to the account never received such a prompt to change the password.  The users for these four accounts did not log onto the accounts again after their last password change.  The passwords for these four accounts were not changed within the annual timeframe.  For the fifth and final account, a shared account did not have a control in place to prompt the user to change the password when the password expired. The fifth account was set up incorrectly, which resulted in the account being configured with a non-expiring password and the account not being included in any entity password management tracking system. 

All five of these accounts, including the shared account with the non-expiring password were active on the Generation Control System (GCS).  The entity retired the GCS and this retirement disabled all five accounts at issue.

The root cause of this violation was that the process associated with password changes did not include a notification to employees who had not logged into an account in over a year.  This major contributing factor involves the management practice of asset and configuration management, which includes controlling changes to assets and configuration items and baselines.  ",CIP-007-3a,R5,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.

The entity utilizes redundant controls for its systems such as password complexity and length requirements.  Furthermore, the entity has monitoring controls in place to alert the appropriate CIP asset owners when failed logon attempts are made for certain assets.  For an outside intruder to exploit these accounts, the intruder would need to infiltrate several layers of firewalls or obtain physical access to a protected Physical Security Perimeter before the intruder could gain access to these accounts.  Lastly, four of the five accounts had prompts in place to force the user to change the password the next time the user logged in; the only issue was that the user did not log back into any of the four accounts and thus did not annually change the passwords on those four accounts.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 3 (RFC_URE3),NCRXXXXX,RFC2015015071,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE3 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R5.  This Self-Report involves three separate noncompliances.  The entity, in its Self-Report, initially discovered an instance where, as a result of improperly elevated access, an IT employee inadvertently patched a generation dispatch system terminal server. 

Specifically, while installing patches on servers and workstations, an IT employee inadvertently installed server patches to this particular terminal server.  Prior to installing these incorrect patches, the entity incorrectly granted the IT employee elevated access that gave him the credentials to patch this terminal server.  The patches the IT employee incorrectly installed had not yet been scheduled for deployment to the server meaning that the patches had also not yet undergone significant change testing.  The entity removed the inadvertently installed patches and notified the Remote Access team of the IT employee’s error and improper elevated access rights.

Following this first issue, while reviewing the patching history of the IT employee at issue in the first instance of noncompliance, the same IT employee applied patches to the generation dispatch production system that were not scheduled for production testing and deployment.  The IT employee was only meant to deploy a certain number of update patches to the Quality Assurance (QA) environment and not the production environment.  While attempting to deploy those patches to the QA environment, the IT employee mistyped the name. As a result of mistyping the letter “P” instead of the letter “Q”, the patches were installed on a single production server.  Unaware that the patch had been applied to the production environment, the IT employee manually rebooted the system, causing the primary server to be offline while rebooting. This reboot triggered a successful failover from the primary to a backup server, as designed, and this failover prevented any operational impact from the patching mistake. 

Following this second issue, the entity expanded its extent of condition to review and fully re-evaluate the consistency and completeness of patching efforts that impact the generation dispatch system. Through this review, the entity identified additional instances of noncompliance pertaining to the entity’s patching of the generation dispatch system. 

As part of the extent of condition review which began after the first issue and was expanded after the second issue, the entity conducted a review of patch assessments performed after the commissioning of the generation dispatch system. This review identified instances where patches relevant to the generation dispatch system were either incorrectly categorized or assessed.  

The root cause of this violation involves the management practice of workforce management through ineffective training and verification through a lack of effective verification processes and procedures.  For the first issue, ineffective training resulted in the IT employee improperly getting elevated access and the IT employee deploying the wrong patches to the wrong server.  For the second issue, a contributing cause was a lack of attention detail through human error in executing patching by the IT employee.  For the third issue, contributing causes were human performance error in the execution of patching assessment activities and a lack of sufficient procedural documentation and training on the proper patch identification and assessment processes.  The entity discovered that the documentation and training that supports patching lacked sufficient substantive detail to guide individuals on how to perform patch assessments.  ",CIP-007-3a,R5,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  For the first issue, the IT employee’s elevated access was limited to certain assets and did not extend into the Bulk Electric System (BES) applications.  Additionally, the server to which the patch was improperly applied is a jump server into the entity’s Private Network (PN).  The jump server does not have administrative access into BES applications.  For the second issue, the reboot to a generation dispatch server resulting from the inadvertently applied patches was addressed within two minutes when a backup server was moved to primary status automatically to account for the server that was taken off-line unexpectedly.  ReliabilityFirst notes that no actual harm occurred because the lapse in the data feed resulted in no loss of data to the generation dispatch system.  Additionally, the entity had completed some testing on the inadvertently installed patches prior to their deployment.  For the third issue, access to the generation dispatch system assets is limited and is protected either by physical access protections such as locked cabinets or electronic access protections such as 2-factor authentication.  ReliabilityFirst notes that no actual harm occurred because the entity experienced no generation dispatch system interruptions or security breaches stemming from any of these issues.  Overall, the entity utilizes secure network architecture and a layer security model based on a defense-in-depth design.

The entity identified instances in which certain Cyber Assets did not perform continuous monitoring and logging functions as required by CIP-007-3a R6.

As part of remediation efforts under a prior mitigation plan, the entity and the entity's corporate information security services team brought a number of Electronic Access Control and Monitoring Systems (EACMS) into CIP compliance including a class of firewall managers used to manage checkpoint firewalls.  All activity for these checkpoint firewalls are collected and logged to a security event management system either directly, or by way of the firewall managers.

The entity discovered that logs from the firewall managers were not consistently collected by the security event management system. Upon further investigation and discussion, the entity determined a software issue was the apparent cause for the logging issue.  Logs with larger file sizes interfered with the firewall agent’s ability to process such logs.

The root cause of this violation involves the management practice of verification.  The entity did not have an effective internal control in place to ensure that the firewall manager’s logs were consistently collected and logged as required by CIP-007-3a R6.  A technical issue with the security event management system software interfered with the firewall agent’s ability to process such logs.  This meant that all logs from the firewall manager were not consistently collected and logged by the security event management system.  This system was not able to resolve this technical issue and the entity found another software, which was able to process the larger file sizes that caused the problems.  ",CIP-007-3a,R6,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  The entity utilizes a defense-in-depth strategy that reduces the risk of unauthorized access attempts.  The entity monitors Electronic Security Perimeter access through active intrusion detection systems.  Access to Critical Cyber Assets (CCAs) requires the potential user to pass through multiple layers of firewalls before accessing the CCA.  These protections mean that changes to the configuration of a single firewall would not, on its own, provide access to an unauthorized user.  Aside from the logging issue, the firewall was functioning properly in that it was effectively controlling what can pass through the device.  Therefore, any changes to the configuration of a single firewall would not, on its own, provide access to an authorized user.  The entity also has other redundant controls in place such as required two-factor authentication and that serves as an alternative mechanism for logging, monitoring, and alerting via Remote Secure Access logs.

An extent of condition review determined that the configurations were duplicated across several devices.  The systems at issue do not have modems and the entity has disabled dial-up access by default.  In fact, none of these devices have any internet access at all.

The root cause of this violation was the failure to properly review an incorrect justification for the service at issue, which was previously needed under a prior operating system.  This major contributing factor involves the management practice of asset and configuration management, which includes establishing inventory and configuration baselines and performing assessments.  ",CIP-007-3a,R2,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  The risk is that leaving the internet connection sharing service enabled could allow threat vectors into an Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) via the affected terminal servers.  This risk was mitigated by the fact that the systems at issue do not have any internet access at all.  This fact reduces the likelihood that this service could be successfully exploited because a connection to the internet would be required for any potential exploitation to be successful.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 4 (RFC_URE4),NCRXXXXX,RFC2015014723,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE4 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R3.  During an internal CIP compliance review, the entity’s IT compliance unit determined that a CIP-Cyber Asset patch was not timely assessed within 30 days of its availability as required by CIP-007 R3.1.  The entity utilizes a management tool administered by the entity’s IT compliance unit to provide a greater degree of automation in the patch management monitoring and assessment process.  Once a patch is entered in that tool as needing assessment, the the IT compliance unit notifies the responsible personnel to perform the required assessment.

In this case, an internal compliance review revealed that a vendor patch was assessed nine days late.  The untimely assessment did not result in any security vulnerability because the patch was ultimately deemed to be inapplicable.  The internal compliance review was performed to verify the effectiveness of a newly implemented compliance tool and associated processes.

The root cause of this violation was internal miscommunication between teams regarding the identification of personnel responsible for performing the required assessment, which prevented the patch from being timely assessed.  Moreover, the patch management tool relies on a properly configured Master Asset List (MAL).  In this case, there was confusion as to the proper formatting and correct methods for data entry into the MAL, which made it difficult for the patch management tool to function optimally.  These major contributing factors involve the management practices of work management, which includes managing organizational work, and asset and configuration management, which includes establishing assets and configuration items inventory and controlling changes.  ",CIP-007-3a,R3,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  The entity utilizes a secure network architecture by employing a layered security model with hardened devices.  This architecture minimizes the risk posed by assessing a patch’s applicability late.  The devices affected by the patch in question are not Internet facing and reside behind several layers of protection and firewalls.  The most common type of attacks occur when a firewall or device is in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that is Internet facing.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 4 (RFC_URE4),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016015934,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE4 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R3.  During regular patch management quality assurance activities related to CIP Version 5 implementation, the entity discovered that security patch reviews for two server management devices were not conducted within 30 days of their release as required by CIP-007-3 R3.1 and entity procedures.   Several patches for two server management devices were not reviewed.  Additionally, these patches were neither installed nor were compensating measures applied as specified CIP-007-3 R3.2 and entity procedures.

After self-reporting this issue with the server management devices, the entity identified two additional patching issues that were also identified during the quality assurance review of the patch management program.  One related to antivirus patching, and the other involved the late assessment of patches for the operating system of Physical Access Control System (PACS) devices.

With respect to the antivirus patching issue, during the entity’s initial run of its new CIP Version 5 process for historical patch discovery, IT personnel identified that entity business units were running different version of the antivirus client installed in their respective environments.  Most of the devices containing the antivirus client had up-to-date versions of the client and did not pose a compliance issue.  However, the entity determined that about 5% of the devices had missed four antivirus client version upgrades, another 3% had missed three version upgrades, another 1% had missed two version upgrades, and the remaining 6% had missed one antivirus client version upgrade.  In total, there were four antivirus client patches involved.

With respect to the PACS patching issue, as part of the entity’s new patch management processes, an automatic Patch Source Review (PSR) is generated within the entity’s primary patch management system.  The patch management system receives patch source information, identifies relevant security patches for particular devices, and generates an automated Device Patch Notification (DPN) to each asset owner to trigger the patch assessment process in a timely manner.  During the early deployment of the patch management system, the entity discovered that due to a failure to correctly identify the devices in software/firmware libraries, DPNs were not generated for the operating system of multiple PACS devices for which patches were identified.  As a result of not receiving these DPNs, the relevant asset owners did not assess the applicability of several unique patches within the 30-day requirement.  However, the due diligence of the patch management system project team support by patch tracking tools and internal controls caught the error quickly, so that the patches in question were assessed 20 days late, and compensating measures were put into place.

The root causes of this violation are as follows:
a. With respect to the server management device issue, the names of the devices had not been correctly entered into the entity’s previous patch tracking systems.  As a result the prior patch tracking systems did not flag the devices for security patch management.  This problem was compounded by the device names also appearing incorrectly on other related tools, such as the central Shared Services Master Asset List, which hindered the detection of the error.
b. With respect to the antivirus issue, the major contributing factor was a lack of clarity and specificity in the entity’s CIP Version 3 patch management procedures.  Those procedures state that the responsible party for patch identification, assessment, and deployment is the asset owner.  The asset owner includes the operating system owner and the application owner.  This fact caused a difference of interpretation between business units as to who was performing the assessments and record keeping for patching the antivirus client.  Additionally, at the time of the violation, entry into the patch tool was a manual process which lacked clarity as to who would perform the entry.
c. With respect to the patch management system issue, the major contributing factor was the failure to correctly identify the devices in software/firmware libraries.

All of these root causes involve the management practice of asset and configuration management, which includes establishing assets and configuration items inventory, controlling changes, and verifying the integrity of such items.  
",CIP-007-3a,R3,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  First, with respect to the devices involved in the server management device and patch management system issues, those devices were protected by multiple network infrastructure layers with separate two factor authentication and do not directly affect Bulk Electric Systems.  Rather, they support backup and update functions of other systems.  Second, with respect to the antivirus issue, the fact that some of the software clients were running older versions of the application did not increase the risk of this noncompliance because newer versions of the software concern the addition of new features, not the library or index of malicious files that the application uses to identify malware.  In other words, the fact that some software clients were running older versions of the application did not affect the entity’s ability to identify and prevent malware because the library of threats was kept current.

Specifically, these accounts included shared accounts, user accounts, administrator accounts, and read-only user accounts.

The entity utilizes redundant controls for its systems including monthly audits of shared and default account usage.  The entity manages knowledge of account passwords on a need-to-know basis and the number of individuals with knowledge of account passwords is extremely limited.  Furthermore, the entity has monitoring controls in place to alert the appropriate CIP asset owners when multiple failed logon attempts are made on NERC CIP assets.  For an unauthorized intruder to exploit these accounts, the intruder would need to infiltrate several layers of firewalls to reach the segregated and isolated Electronic Security Perimeter with 2-factor authentication required or obtain unescorted physical access to a protected Physical Security Perimeter before they could gain access to these accounts.  To get to the servers, one would need to first log in successfully to the corresponding SCADA nodes, which have limited accessibility, using completely different credentials.  The accounts used to log into the SCADA nodes are in full compliance in following password change requirements and the passwords are unique to each device, providing protection. The risk of unauthorized access to the EMS Time Clock is also limited by the fact that access itself to the EMS Time Clock does not provide a significant threat vector.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 4 (RFC_URE4),NCRXXXXX,RFC2015014722,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE4 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R6.  The entity identified instances in which certain Cyber Assets did not perform continuous monitoring and logging functions as required by CIP-007-3a R6.

As part of remediation efforts under a prior mitigation plan, the entity brought a number of Electronic Access Control and Monitoring Systems (EACMS) into CIP compliance, including a class of firewall managers used to manage checkpoint firewalls.  All activity for these checkpoint firewalls are collected and logged to a security event management system either directly, or by way of the firewall managers.

The entity discovered that logs from the firewall managers were not consistently collected by the security event management system.  Upon further investigation and discussions with the vendor, the entity determined that a software issue was the apparent cause for the logging issue. Logs with larger file sizes interfered with the firewall agent’s ability to process such logs.

While the entity was moving forward with the mitigation involving the security event management system and the checkpoint devices, it discovered issues arising from the deployment of the system to perform monitoring and logging on servers and workstations.  The entity attempted to connect multiple servers and workstations to the security event management system for continuous monitoring and logging.  The Cyber Assets were to be placed into the Energy Management System (EMS) production environment.  While trying to configure the security event management system in the test environment, the entity unsuccessfully attempted off-boarding the old devices and on-boarding the new devices to log to the security event management system.  Following this unsuccessful attempt, the entity relied on manual monitoring to be compliant with CIP-007 R6 when the devices were moved into production.  Once in production, however, the default policy size for storage of log files on the devices was too small to hold all necessary security logs to facilitate manual monitoring, and eventually, logs were overwritten once the storage was full.  The entity adjusted the log storage size for the devices to properly capture adequate logs. As a result of the technical issues deploying the security event management system and the default log storage size on the devices, logs were not available. 

The root cause of this violation involves the management practice of verification.  The entity did not have an effective internal control in place to ensure that the firewall manager’s logs were consistently collected and logged as required by CIP-007-3a R6.  A technical issue with the security event management system software interfered with the firewall agent’s ability to process such logs.  This meant that all logs from the firewall manager were not consistently collected and logged by the security event management system.  The security event management system was not able to resolve this technical issue and the entity found another software, which was able to process the larger file sizes that caused the problems.  For the servers and workstations instance of noncompliance, a contributing cause was a failure of personnel to follow procedures to continue work to resolve technical issues with the security event management system in the test environment.   ",CIP-007-3a,R6,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  The entity utilizes a defense-in-depth strategy that reduces the risk of unauthorized access attempts.  The entity monitors Electronic Security Perimeter access through active intrusion detection systems.  Access to Critical Cyber Assets (CCAs) requires the potential user to pass through multiple layers of firewalls before accessing the CCA.  These protections mean that changes to the configuration of a single firewall would not, on its own, provide access to an unauthorized user.  Aside from the logging issue, the firewall was functioning properly in that it was effectively controlling what can pass through the device.  Therefore, any changes to the configuration of a single firewall would not, on its own, provide access to an authorized user.  The entity also has other redundant controls in place such as required two-factor authentication and that serves as an alternative mechanism for logging, monitoring, and alerting via Remote Secure Access logs.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 4 (RFC_URE4),NCRXXXXX,RFC2017016756,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE4 submitted a Self-Report stating that it had an issue of CIP-007-6 R4.  The entity conducted an internal self-assessment of compliance with CIP-007-6 R4, including gathering evidence of reviewing a summary of logged events.  The entity discovered that for sample dates of the 1st and 15th of two months, the records associated with the summary reviews for certain firewalls at the entity were incomplete, meaning that the reviews were not completed properly.  Further review determined that stored security event logs had not been consistently reviewed, and, therefore, the reviews were not documented as required by the entity’s procedure and by CIP-007-6 R4, Part 4.4, which requires a review at intervals no greater than 15 calendar days to identify undetected Cyber Security Incidents.

The root cause of this noncompliance was an insufficient procedure for performing the reviews and a lack of quality control for verifying the completeness of the reviews.  First, the procedure failed to establish a backup performer for this activity.  The heavy and unbalanced workload for the employee responsible for performing the summary reviews prevented all reviews from being completed in a timely manner.  Second, the procedure for performing these reviews was unclear regarding which reports were required to be completed for the review.  Finally, the entity did not have adequate internal preventative controls in place to ensure that the reviews were completed in a timely manner. These major contributing factors involve the management practice of work management, which includes managing organizational work, and verification, which includes establishing verification procedures and criteria.  ",CIP-007-6,R4,Medium,High,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  First, the summary review of logs associated with these firewalls was not the only method by which the entity sought to identify security threats.  The monitoring team also reduced the risk associated with potential malicious actions by monitoring events on a network as well as on an asset level.  For instance, the monitoring team performs summary reviews of the Cyber Assets within the Electronic Security Perimeters as well to ensure awareness of its systems.  Second, during the time period in question, at no time was the capability of performance of logging interrupted.  ReliabilityFirst also notes that no actual harm occurred because there were no undetected Cyber Security Incidents and negative impacts to any Bulk Electric System Cyber Systems during the time period in question.

","Settlement Agreement

","During a Compliance Audit conducted from June 6 to June 9, 2016, SPP RE determined that BPU, as a Transmission Operator (TOP), was in violation of FAC-014-2 R5.2 and as a Transmission Planner (TP), was in violation of FAC-014-2 R5.4.  BPU’s Facility Ratings Methodology (FRM) provides that the emergency ratings for its transmission lines are equal to the normal ratings.  Accordingly, the System Operating Limits (SOLs) for BPU’s transmission lines are based upon the normal Facility Ratings.  Nevertheless, for five of the BPU 161 kV transmission lines examined by the SPP RE Audit Team, BPU submitted emergency SOLs that were higher than the normal Facility Ratings to its Reliability Coordinator (RC) and Planning Authority, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP).  

The root cause for this noncompliance was a lack of coordination between the BPU TOP and TP functional groups. Although both BPU functional groups utilize the Facility Ratings developed by the BPU Electric Engineering department as the foundation for SOLs and Facility Ratings, the emergency ratings submitted by the TO and TP to SPP were inconsistent with the BPU FRM.

When planning and operational models contain such errors, the potential exists for operational problems to go unidentified and/or the development of incorrect responses to operational issues.  Here, the risk to the BPS is minimal because: 1) the BPU transmission system operates at a lower transmission voltage (161 kV); 2) the inaccurate SOLs were limited to the emergency ratings in planning models; and 3) BPU is a small municipal electric utility with only 61 miles of 161 kV transmission line and a peak load of 529 MW.

","Settlement Agreement

","During a Compliance Audit conducted from June 6 to June 9, 2016, SPP RE determined that BPU, as a Transmission Owner, was in violation of FAC-008-3 R6.  The SPP RE Audit Team identified multiple issues with BPU’s Facility Ratings in finding that BPU did not have Facility Ratings for its solely and jointly owned Facilities that were consistent with its Facility Ratings Methodology (FRM).

Issue #1. The Facility Ratings documentation utilized by BPU to document its substation Facility Ratings contained errors and omissions material to the determination of the BPU Facility Ratings.  

BPU failed to identify all the equipment in its substations necessary for the determination of the substation Facility Ratings and utilized incorrect ratings for the equipment in its substations.  These errors were present in the Facility Ratings for 15 of BPU’s 17 substations and resulted in material changes to the Facility Ratings for 7 of the 17 substations. 

Issue #2.  The Facility Ratings documentation utilized by BPU to document its transmission line Facility Ratings contained errors and omissions material to the determination of the BPU Facility Ratings.

BPU failed to accurately document the Facility Ratings for transmission lines owned by or jointly owned with Kansas City Power & Light (KCPL).  The Facility Ratings for four of the eight KCPL transmission lines were either omitted completely from the BPU documentation or incorrectly rated.  The Maywood – Maywood South, Maywood South – Metropolitan and Woolcott – Maywood 161 kV transmission lines were omitted from the BPU documentation.  The Metropolitan – Shawnee Mission 161 kV tie line was included in the BPU Documentation, however, the Facility Rating was incorrectly identified as 224 MVA and not 293 MVA.  

The root cause of this noncompliance was a lack of internal controls to ensure the accuracy and availability of documentation used in the development of BPU’s Facility Ratings.

",High,High,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the Bulk Power System (BPS).  The failure to utilize accurate transmission facility ratings has the potential to: 1) compromise planning and operational models; 2) result in inaccurate protection system settings and Energy Management System alarm set points; and 3) cause operators to respond inappropriately to system events. Here, the risk to the BPS is mitigated because the BPU transmission system operates at a lower transmission voltage (161 kV) and BPU is a small municipal electric utility with only 61 miles of 161 kV transmission line and a peak load of 529 MW.

LWU failed to establish Facility Ratings that were consistent with the associated Facility Ratings Methodology.

LWU did not identify the most limiting Element for one of seven (14 percent) Facilities. When determining the Facility Rating for the Hypoluxo substation to Main substation 138 kV line, the current transformers (CTs) at Hypoluxo substation were not considered when the Facility Ratings were determined. Therefore, LWU did not have Facility Ratings for its solely and jointly owned Facilities that are consistent with the associated Facility Rating Methodology or documentation for determining its Facility Ratings. LWU owns seven Facilities consisting of 81 components. The audit team reviewed all 81 and found one (.012%) with an incorrect Facility Rating. 

The root cause for this violation was insufficient documentation of the ratings for individual components. Additionally, the nameplate data in the field was misinterpreted due to age, corrosion, and general condition. ",FAC-008-3,R6.,Medium,High,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS).  

LWU’s failure to include all Bulk Electric System (BES) components of a Facility when establishing a Facility Rating could have led to inadvertently overloading one BES component (i.e., the CTs) by approximately 200 percent. The incorrect Facility Rating could have led to misoperations, equipment damage, or catastrophic failure of one LWU-owned CT.  Importantly, such a failure could impact the local area but would not adversely impact broader BPS reliability. LWU did not exceed the corrected facility ratings during the violation timeframe. LWU’s peak load of 100 MW represents only .0022 percent of the total load within the FRCC Region. 

The lack of, or inaccuracies in, documenting Facility Ratings appear to be systemic issues that exist within LWU’s Facility Rating Methodology, as previously disclosed under the Full Notice of Penalty in FRCC2014013685 and FRCC200900252.

During the Spot Check, FRCC found that LWU's internal compliance program (ICP) continued to be deficient and was a contributing factor to the additional violations discovered.

The deficiencies with the ICP included a lack of effective management oversight of compliance personnel, which contributed to the number of issues found during the Spot Check and the general issues LWU experienced in providing accurate and timely responses to FRCC. As a result, FRCC did not apply mitigating credit for LWU's ICP. Additionally, five of the six violations included in this SNOP began on the same date, due to a lack of awareness, which is indicative of a systemic failure of the program.

After the Spot Check, LWU began taking steps to improve their ICP. As detailed in the mitigating activities, LWU retained a third-party consultant with extensive NERC experience to support LWU's overall NERC compliance program.

To support the overall compliance enhancement process, LWU is developing and implementing a compliance tracking system for ongoing NERC compliance activities.  

FRCC and LWU have agreed to several actions to address these concerns. First, FRCC and LWU have agreed that LWU's City Manager will execute this Settlement Agreement. This action will ensure that LWU's executive leadership is fully aware of these issues and is committed to driving continuous improvement in LWU's posture across its organization. Second, FRCC will perform additional monitoring related to PER-005-2 in 2019. Third, LWU will continue to contract for outside compliance support over a multi-year timeframe.

","On December 22, 2016, ERCOT submitted a Self-Report stating that, as a Reliability Coordinator (RC), it was in violation of IRO-002-2 R7.  Specifically, ERCOT failed to continuously monitor its RC Area for approximately 47 minutes during an issue with its Energy Management System (EMS) on July 7, 2016. This was a category 1.h.i event, loss of monitoring or control at a Control Center such that it significantly affects the entity's ability to make operating decisions for 30 continuous minutes or more, specifically, this was a loss of operator ability to remotely monitor or control Bulk Electric System (BES) elements.

In order to monitor its RC Area, ERCOT possesses four EMS servers, with one operating as the primary EMS server and three operating as backups.  ERCOT uses two primary tools to monitor its RC Area, including monitoring System Operating Limits (SOLs) and Interconnection Reliability Operating Limits (IROLs) for pre- and post-Contingency exceedances.  First, ERCOT uses a Real-Time Monitoring Contingency Analysis (RTCA) tool.  Second, ERCOT uses a Real-Time Network Analysis (RTNET) tool to perform state estimation functions.  In addition to its ongoing RC Area monitoring activities, ERCOT uses data snapshots from the active EMS server to develop system recovery and planning models.  

On July 7, 2016, an ERCOT system analyst was performing a weekly model verification upload and inadvertently loaded the previous week’s model into the EMS server’s active production environment.  As a result, the active EMS server attempted to use this bad data and lost the ability to monitor the RC Area at 11:41:31.  The data from the active EMS server replicated to the three standby EMS servers as designed.  At 11:43:15, ERCOT personnel attempted to failover to the backup EMS servers, but this failover was unsuccessful because the corrupt data had already replicated on all of ERCOT’s EMS servers.  

As these EMS troubleshooting activities occurred, ERCOT personnel began implementing its established emergency procedures to address its loss of direct monitoring capability.  Specifically, at 12:00:12, ERCOT issued a hotline call to all Transmission Operators (TOPs) to monitor their service areas and notify ERCOT of any Transmission Facilities that exceeded their normal Facility Ratings, any power flows that reached 85% of a Transmission Facility’s applicable limits, and any forced line operations.  At 12:02:42, ERCOT issued a hotline call to Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) regarding its EMS monitoring issues.  Finally, at 12:05:25, ERCOT issued a second hotline call to all TOPs to update them regarding its ongoing EMS monitoring issues.  

As ERCOT personnel implemented its established emergency procedures, they likewise continued troubleshooting activities.  Specifically, ERCOT personnel successfully reloaded a previous model save case and restored the EMS system’s production environment.  ERCOT personnel then disabled a feature for archiving RTCA results and modified several excessive data mismatches within RTNET.  With these steps, both the RTNET and RTCA ran successfully at 12:28:48.  As a result, ERCOT regained the ability to continuously monitor its RC Area, ending the noncompliance.  

The root cause of this violation was that ERCOT lacked adequate controls to prevent the introduction of corrupt data into its EMS production environment.  In particular, ERCOT did not technically preclude its personnel from inadvertently loading model cases into the EMS production environment or include cautionary messages or other prompts to prevent such actions.  
",IRO-002-2,R7,High,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk to the reliability of the bulk power system.  Specifically, ERCOT’s inability to directly monitor its RC Area potentially increased the risk that it would be unable to identify and respond to a potential contingency in a timely manner.

However, a number of factors reduced the risks presented by ERCOT’s monitoring issue in the current circumstances.  First, ERCOT possessed emergency procedures for responding to this type of monitoring capability loss, including instructions to issue hotline calls to TOPs to ensure the system was monitored by additional entities for previously identified critical reliability elements.  These emergency procedures also include detailed steps for detecting and addressing any exceedances such as identifying the area of concern, viewing one-line displays, and directing generation to adjust output.  During the issue in question, ERCOT personnel successfully implemented these emergency procedures to coordinate with RC Area TOPs.  Specifically, within 20 minutes of the loss of its monitoring capability, ERCOT issued hotline calls and emergency notices to all TOPs to monitor their service areas and notify ERCOT of any Transmission Facilities that exceeded their normal Facility Ratings, any power flows that reached 85% of a Transmission Facility’s applicable limits, and any forced line operations.  No entities within the ERCOT RC Area notified ERCOT that they were experiencing such problems.  Further, there were no SOL exceedances during the issue duration.  In addition, ERCOT notified all QSEs regarding its EMS issues and remained in communication with two QSEs for large GOPs in the RC Area to maintain frequency and secure additional generation resources as necessary to address issues.  Texas RE also considered ERCOT’s troubleshooting efforts to reduce the duration of the monitoring issue.  In particular, these efforts limited the issue duration to 47 minutes, less than the 73 minute average duration for EMS outages across the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) between October 2013 and April 2017.  Finally, ERCOT possesses a number of enhanced system restoration plans and conducts routine drills on their implementation, reducing the likelihood that it would not adequately respond to a contingency if one had occurred during the issue.

2) restored its ability to continuously monitor its RC Area; 
3) revised the database loading script to remove the capability to load model cases into the active EMS Server; 
4) added a banner to the database scripts to clearly label them as “Production Servers”;
5) removed the snapshot creation option from the model load process to prevent accidental loading of the model case to the online production environment;
6) implemented a change to automatically save four days of RTCA solutions in a more accessible location to enable quicker resolution should another EMS outage occur;
7) conducted operator and shift engineer training on loss of EMS, including a review of the event in question; and

","Texas RE reviewed ERCOT's internal compliance program and considered it to be a neutral factor in the penalty determination.

ERCOT was subject to event reporting requirements for a complete loss of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) EMS and submitted such EOP-004 reports to identify these issues.  Accordingly, Texas RE did not award self-reporting credit.  

Texas RE also considered ERCOT’s ongoing efforts to invest resources and project funding to strengthen its Real-Time Analysis (RTA) capabilities for other scenarios.  Although the issues identified have been fully mitigated, ERCOT is implementing system design changes to use other approaches to support RTA, including creating the ability to bypass the EMS system to connect to SCADA data directly in the case of a corrupt EMS.  ERCOT has participated in NERC workshops sharing these types of technical alternatives across the industry.  The project is presently scheduled for implementation in 2018 with a cost of approximately $160,000.

","On December 22, 2016, ERCOT submitted a Self-Report stating that, as a Reliability Coordinator (RC), it was in violation of IRO-003-2 R2.  Specifically, ERCOT failed to know the current status of all critical facilities whose failure, degradation or disconnection could result in a System Operating Limit (SOL) and Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit (IROL) violation, as well as the status of any facilities that may be required to assist area restoration objectives for approximately 47 minutes on July 7, 2016.  This was a category 1.h.i event, loss of monitoring or control at a Control Center such that it significantly affects the entity's ability to make operating decisions for 30 continuous minutes or more, specifically, this was a loss of operator ability to remotely monitor or control Bulk Electric System (BES) elements.

In order to monitor its RC Area, ERCOT possesses four Energy Management System (EMS) servers, with one operating as the primary EMS server and three operating as backups.  ERCOT uses two primary tools to monitor its RC Area, including monitoring SOLs and IROLs for pre- and post-Contingency exceedances.  First, ERCOT uses a Real-Time Monitoring Contingency Analysis (RTCA) tool.  Second, ERCOT uses a Real-Time Network Analysis (RTNET) tool to perform state estimation functions.  In addition to its ongoing RC Area monitoring activities, ERCOT uses data snapshots from the active EMS server to develop system recovery and planning models.  

On July 7, 2016, an ERCOT system analyst was performing a weekly model verification upload and inadvertently loaded the previous week’s model into the EMS server’s active production environment.  As a result, the active EMS server attempted to use this bad data and lost the ability to monitor the RC Area at 11:41:31.  The data from the active EMS server replicated to the three standby EMS servers as designed.  At 11:43:15, ERCOT personnel attempted to failover to the backup EMS servers, but this failover was unsuccessful because the corrupt data had already replicated on all of ERCOT’s EMS servers.  

As these EMS troubleshooting activities occurred, ERCOT personnel began implementing its established emergency procedures to address its loss of direct monitoring capability.  Specifically, at 12:00:12, ERCOT issued a hotline call to all Transmission Operators (TOPs) to monitor their service areas and notify ERCOT of any Transmission Facilities that exceeded their normal Facility Ratings, any power flows that reached 85% of a Transmission Facility’s applicable limits, and any forced line operations.  At 12:02:42, ERCOT issued a hotline call to Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) regarding its EMS monitoring issues.  Finally, at 12:05:25, ERCOT issued a second hotline call to all TOPs to update them regarding its ongoing EMS monitoring issues.  

As ERCOT personnel implemented its established emergency procedures, they likewise continued troubleshooting activities.  Specifically, ERCOT personnel successfully reloaded a previous model save case and restored the EMS system’s production environment.  ERCOT personnel then disabled a feature for archiving RTCA results and modified several excessive data mismatches within RTNET.  With these steps, both the RTNET and RTCA ran successfully at 12:28:48.  As a result, ERCOT regained the ability to continuously monitor its RC Area, ending the noncompliance.

The root cause of this violation was that ERCOT lacked adequate controls to prevent the introduction of corrupt data into its EMS production environment.  In particular, ERCOT did not technically preclude its personnel from inadvertently loading model cases into the EMS production environment or include cautionary messages or other prompts to prevent such actions.  ",IRO-003-2,R2,High,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk to the reliability of the bulk power system as ERCOT successfully followed emergency procedures in coordination with other entities and there was no loss of Load and no SOL or IROL exceedances.  Specifically, ERCOT’s failure to know the current status of all critical facilities for 47 minutes increased the risk that it would be unable to identify and/or properly respond to a potential contingency in a timely manner.

However, a number of factors reduced the risks presented by ERCOT’s monitoring issue in the current circumstances.  First, ERCOT possessed emergency procedures for responding to this type of monitoring capability loss, including instructions to issue hotline calls to TOPs to ensure the system was monitored by additional entities for previously identified critical reliability elements.  These emergency procedures also include detailed steps for detecting and addressing any exceedances such as identifying the area of concern, viewing one-line displays, and directing generation to adjust output.  During the issue in question, ERCOT personnel successfully implemented these emergency procedures to coordinate with RC Area TOPs.  Specifically, within 20 minutes of the loss of its monitoring capability, ERCOT issued hotline calls and emergency notices to all TOPs to monitor their service areas and notify ERCOT of any Transmission Facilities that exceeded their normal Facility Ratings, any power flows that reached 85% of a Transmission Facility’s applicable limits, and any forced line operations.  No entities within the ERCOT RC Area notified ERCOT that they were experiencing such problems.  Further, there were no SOL exceedances during the issue duration.  In addition, ERCOT notified all QSEs regarding its EMS issues and remained in communication with two QSEs for large GOPs in the RC Area to maintain frequency and secure additional generation resources as necessary to address issues.  Texas RE also considered ERCOT’s troubleshooting efforts to reduce the duration of the monitoring issue.

Texas RE subsequently determined that the duration pertaining to TRE_URE1's testing procedure issues started earlier than July 1, 2016.  Accordingly, Texas RE determined that TRE_URE1 was in violation of CIP-007-3a R1, and TRE_URE1 was then in violation of CIP-010-2 R1, Parts 1.5, 1.5.1, and 1.5.2.  Texas RE further determined that, for purposes of this issue, there was no substantive change in TRE_URE1's compliance obligations under the Standards at issue.  

TRE_URE1 implemented a new Information Technology Change Management (ITCM) tool and related processes to better control its change authorization process, security testing, and baseline configuration tracking as part of its overall efforts to transition to the CIP Version 5/6 Standards. TRE_URE1 personnel implemented changes to a number of Cyber Assets using an incorrect workflow option embedded in the new ITCM tool that did not include a step for performing security controls testing.  

TRE_URE1 discovered the issue during a review of change records. The following day, TRE_URE1 issued instructions to personnel on the steps necessary to select the proper workflows to ensure all required security controls testing activities for NERC Cyber Assets were performed prior to implementing any changes to those assets.  TRE_URE1 provided additional training to its personnel regarding the need to perform security controls testing and the proper process for ensuring its timely completion within the new ITCM tool environment.  TRE_URE1 sent an email to Texas RE disclosing known issues related to security controls testing. Over the next few months, TRE_URE1 worked to resolve the security controls testing issues associated with the transition to its ITCM tool. TRE_URE1 personnel performed the final required security controls testing for all approved changes, ending the issue.

The root cause of these noncompliance instances was an insufficient understanding of the new change management process implemented as part of the CIP Version 5/6 transition. In particular, TRE_URE1 failed to implement its new ITCM tool in a manner that would prevent TRE_URE1 employees from choosing a workflow that bypassed required security testing prior to placing changes to Cyber Assets into production.  
",CIP-007-3a,R1,Medium,Severe,"This issue posed a moderate risk to the reliability of the bulk power system. Failure to perform security controls testing prior to implementing changes in a production environment could create vulnerabilities in affected systems or cause those systems to fail.  The changes at issue involved less than five percent of the overall changes related to BES Cyber Assets during the issue period.

However, the risk posed by this issue was also mitigated by the following factors. TRE_URE1's established process is to apply any system changes or updates to hardware and/or software in its passive data center first to determine if there are any adverse impacts. This process includes ongoing operational monitoring to identify any failures with the systems and active security event monitoring to identify any security anomalies that would then be investigated, reducing any potential risks that vulnerabilities or adverse impacts could occur on TRE_URE1's system. When TRE_URE1 performed the appropriate security controls testing on all applicable Cyber Assets, it did not identify any adverse effect of security controls with any of the changes to its production systems. In addition, TRE_URE1 had a number of cyber security systems in place, including automated security event monitoring controls, intrusion detection systems, application whitelisting, full packet capture, vulnerability assessments, and antivirus software. In particular, TRE_URE1 has invested heavily in an email protection architecture in which incoming emails are scanned through multiple sandbox technologies and all URLs are re-written and passed through a security analysis gateway. TRE_URE1 personnel also apply various threat analysis perspectives to categorize different advanced actor campaigns to continuously detect and prevent attacks.  

Throughout the violation period, these controls did not detect any anomalies, malicious traffic, or malicious code, and TRE_URE1 did not have any Reportable Cyber Security Incidents during the audit period. Based upon review of documents provided during the audit and observation of the data centers during the audit, the compliance audit team further concluded that the changes applied did not negatively impact Control Center or data operations. Finally, TRE_URE1's established process requires that as part of submission of the production change request, submitters are required to provide information regarding functional testing performed. By providing this information during the change authorization process, TRE_URE1 reduced the potential risk that the changes at issue could have an adverse impact on its system.

1) completed security controls testing in accordance with all applicable NERC Reliability Standard requirements; 
2) completed implementation of modifications to the automated workflow forms to prevent employees from selecting incorrect workflows bypassing required security controls testing, including implementing a process to require all change and deployment requests to be reviewed and validated by change coordinators before the change is allowed to progress through the selected workflows and precluding any change and deployment requests from progressing further in the workflow process until the security controls testing is successfully performed;
3) implemented a new checklist to ensure that NERC assets are correctly identified and are tested in compliance with NERC Reliability Standards; 
4) conducted training pertaining to CIP-010 configuration change management for affected employees; and
5) instituted disciplinary actions for a single employee that did not follow the prescribed change management process.

Additionally, TRE_URE1 will complete the following mitigation actions:

1) enhance change management and new project processes to improve compliance involvement and oversight of project development activities, including directly assigning compliance staff to applicable project development teams;
2) revise the existing ITCM workflows or processes to require confirmation that all applicable security controls testing has occurred prior to closing out an ITCM change ticket;
3) establish a process to ensure correct workflows have been selected and appropriate Cyber Security tasks have been performed before Cyber Assets are placed into the production environment;  
4) establish an explicit requirement that any omitted security controls testing will be designated as a high priority task and performed as soon as reasonably practicable; and
5) conduct additional training on the ITCM workflow process, the process changes made as part of the mitigation of this issue, and the requirement to perform all cyber security testing activities prior to placing Cyber Assets into production.

","TRE_URE1 submitted a Self-Report stating that it was in violation of CIP-010-2 R1. In particular, TRE_URE1 discovered that it had failed to add multiple newly installed physical access control system (PACS) panels to its baseline configurations within 30 days, as required under CIP-010-2 R1, part 1.1.

TRE_URE1 began the process to install a new PACS for its primary and backup Control Centers. As part of this process, IT personnel began to install a number of PACS access control panels at various Control Center locations. IT personnel selected an incorrect workflow that was not intended for new NERC Cyber Assets. As such, the following month, TRE_URE1 personnel placed the panels at issue into production without completing the baseline configurations within 30 days for the panels as required.  

TRE_URE1 discovered the issue during a cross-functional meeting.  Following this meeting, TRE_URE1 personnel created the proper build request tickets to ensure that baseline configurations of the panels would be completed. TRE_URE1 personnel then established the initial baseline configurations for the panels at issue ending the noncompliance for this issue.

The root cause of these instances of noncompliance was an insufficient understanding of the new change management process. Specifically, TRE_URE1 lacked a documented process to ensure its personnel properly identified all new NERC Cyber Assets, and did not provide an explicit location option for PACS panels in the correct new build workflow.  
",CIP-010-2 ,R1; P1.1,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system for several reasons.  First, the panels at issue were locked and tamper protected, and only two TRE_URE1 staff members had access to the panels.  Second, the panels at issue were all configured in an encrypted mode, which helps ensure the integrity of the data and prevent the introduction of malicious code. Third, the BES Cyber Systems for TRE_URE1 are located inside an Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) and are protected by firewall(s), which control access to the ESP systems, as well as additional layers of firewalls specific to the PACS network restricting any unauthorized access by the panels to the BES Cyber Systems. Fourth, in the event of a breach of the panels, the devices would not accept invalid data formats. In the event the data was sent in an unrecognizable format, the panels would initiate a reboot, which would send an alert to TRE_URE1 security operations console. No alerts were sent during the time period at issue. Fifth, if the panels were to fail, the biometric readers at the door would fail to close and use the access credentials stored locally.  Sixth, all access points to the Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs) are monitored by cameras and TRE_URE1 security personnel at all times. Finally, TRE_URE1 possessed a number of cyber security systems, including automated security event monitoring controls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software. Throughout the violation period, these controls did not detect any anomalies, malicious traffic, or malicious code. TRE_URE1 confirmed that during the time period at issue, there were no changes to the three panels that would have resulted in a deviation to the baseline and TRE_URE1 did not have any Reportable Cyber Security Incidents during the issue duration.

","Minnkota Power Cooperative, Inc. (MPC) ",NCR01013,MRO2016016401,Settlement Agreement,"On June 2, 2016, MPC submitted a Self-Report stating that, as a Transmission Owner, it was in violation of FAC-009-1 R1. MPC had Facility Ratings that were not consistent with MPC's Facility Rating methodology. During a 2015 annual review, MPC reviewed five Bulk Electric System (BES) Facilities and revealed errors affecting equipment and BES Facility Ratings at three of the Facilities. Because the error seemed to be more than just an isolated occurrence, MPC decided to initiate a comprehensive review of all ratings to determine the depth of the error as well as ensure that other Facilities did not experience errors similar in nature. During the review, MPC found, aside from the current transformer (CT) emergency rating error for summer and winter seasons, a number of other mistakes were made as well. Specifically, MPC had 77 Facilities that contained 2,753 pieces of rated equipment; 47 of MPC's 77 Facilities contained at least one equipment rating errors (11 of 77 overall Facility Ratings were affected by the equipment rating errors).  In 11 instances, these errors resulted in a change to the overall Facility Rating. Seven of these 11 Facilities had a change that represented a decrease in the Facility's overall rating. Five of these seven were Transmission Lines that operated above 200 kV. MRO reviewed the historical data for the five Transmission Lines. One of these five Transmission Lines is a radial line that had a maximum loading of 88% of the corrected rating. For each of the remaining four Transmission Lines, MRO determined that the maximum loading was less than 50% of the corrected rating. 

MPC had a prior FAC-009-1 R1 violation (MRO2012010744) that was completed on May 27, 2014. However, many of the errors detected in the 2016 review existed prior to the implementation of the previous Mitigation Plan. As part of the Mitigation Plan for the prior violation, MPC committed to performing a comprehensive assessment of its Facility Ratings. In addition, after the prior violation, MPC implemented an internal control that consisted of an annual review of a sample of its Facility Ratings. MPC detected the current violation in the first execution of this annual review. 

There are three primary causes to the violation:

1) a significant number of the Facility Ratings methodology errors were the result of not including all applicable equipment into the applicable Facility Rating;  
2) MPC determined that it does not correctly apply its Facility Rating methodology to CT ratings and line conductor temperature assumptions, and this was not previously detected because the application of its Facility Rating methodology was not a subject of the prior Mitigation Plan; and  
3) the Facility Ratings data repository and associated spreadsheets used during the prior Mitigation Plan did not have any features to mitigate against data entry errors or omissions when entering equipment ratings.



",FAC-009-1,R1,Medium,High  ,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS).  Specifically, the risk was not minimal because seven Facilities had a Facility Rating that was higher than its actual/corrected Facility Rating. Five of these seven were Transmission Lines that operate above 200 kV, and one of those five Transmission Lines had a Facility Rating decrease of 33% after it was corrected. Further, the scope and duration of the noncompliance was significant, as 47 of MPC's 77 Facilities had associated equipment ratings errors, and some of these errors have existed since the enforceability of FAC-009-1 R1. However, the risk of the noncompliance was not serious or substantial, as a review of historical loading data confirmed that of the five Transmission Lines that operated above 200 kV that had a Facility Ratings decrease, the maximum loading of the radial line was 88% of the corrected rating and the maximum loading for each of the remaining four Transmission Lines was less than 50% of the corrected rating. Additionally, none of the six Facilities whose Facility Ratings were decreased are associated with an Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit or Cranking Path. Finally, the issue was identified through a functioning detective control. No harm is known to have occurred.","6/18/2007 (when the Standard became mandatory and enforceable on MPC)

2) performed a peer review validation of all the Facility Ratings; 
3) revised its Facility Rating Procedure to allow for professional judgment of minor discrepancies; 
4) developed an enhanced Facility Ratings spreadsheet;
5) transferred old equipment ratings into the new enhanced Facility Ratings spreadsheet;
6) performed final review of new spreadsheets and loaded the new Facility Ratings spreadsheets into a compliance software tool; 
7) committed to continued annual sampling of 10% of its Facility Ratings; 
8) shifted responsibility for maintaining Facility Ratings away from a general Compliance Engineer and to the Project Engineer; and
9) is in the process of implementing a corporate objective aimed at improving Project Management and job planning. MPC's NERC Compliance obligations, including FAC-008/009, are embedded in these procedures.

",12/22/2017,Admits,"MRO reviewed MPC's internal compliance program (ICP) and considered it to be a mitigating factor in the penalty determination. MPC has a strong self-audit program. Additionally, MPC has worked to operationalize compliance in its ICP by designating an operations employee to be the standard owner for ensuring compliance with a NERC Reliability Standard, assigning another employee to assist the standard owner, and also requiring compliance staff and the standard owner work together on all Self-Reports as well as the development and implementation of any mitigating activities. 

MRO considered the nature and quality of MPC's cooperation to be a mitigating factor in the penalty determination. MRO considered MPC's Self-Report of the violation to be a mitigating factor in the penalty determination. 

MRO considered MPC’s FAC-009-1 R1 compliance history in determining the penalty. MPC’s relevant prior noncompliance with FAC-009-1 R1 includes: NERC Violation ID MRO2012010744 (FAC-009-1 R1). The prior violation was discovered during in preparation of MPC's 2012 Compliance Audit. As part of its Mitigation Plan, MPC committed, among other actions, to perform a detailed review of all of its Facility Ratings. Additionally, MPC implemented an internal control to self-audit a sample of existing Facility Ratings on an annual basis. However, the prior mitigation did not, nor could have, included a review of equipment ratings that were missing from the Facility Rating Data and associated spreadsheets. When MRO sampled equipment ratings during the first Mitigation Plan, it found no outstanding issues. However, through the course of this second violation, it was discovered that some of MPC’s equipment was not included in the database and therefore not subject to the mitigation verification activities that MRO performed in 2014. Additionally, the prior mitigation did not focus on the application of MPC’s Facility Rating Methodology to CT ratings and line conductor temperature assumptions, and the ratings database used during prior mitigation did not have any features to mitigate data entry errors.

MRO considered MPC's compliance history to be an aggravating factor in the penalty determination. While the Mitigation Plan corrected many of its Facility Ratings, and the scope and severity of the Facility Rating errors were reduced, MPC's implementation of the prior Mitigation Plan did not detect and correct a significant number of Facility Ratings as evidenced by the current noncompliance, although some of the current noncompliance was caused by factors not addressed in the prior mitigation plan. Finally, MRO recognizes that MPC did successfully implement an annual Facility Ratings review that detected the current noncompliance during the first annual review, and aggravated the penalty to a lesser degree due to that internal control.   

Based on the above and beyond activity, MRO applied credit to the penalty. MPC has committed to developing a tool that assists in calculating and managing BES Facility Ratings. The database will enhance reliability by enforcing data quality by validating equipment and facility information entered to ensure the required data is entered and that the data values meet pre-defined conditions, automating monitoring, and enforcing MPC's Facility Ratings, in addition to other reliability benefits. MPC has stated that the database will be fully implemented by year-end 2019. The cost of fully implementing the database is estimated at approximately $131,000. "
ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 1 (RFC_URE1),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016016443,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-004-6 R4. This violation includes six separate instances.

First, during the entity’s quarterly review, the entity identified an individual that was included in four Active Directory groups that improperly granted electronic access to identified Electronic Access Control or Monitoring Systems (EACMS). The individual at issue had a completed an up to date NERC CIP training and a valid Personnel Risk Assessment (PRA). The individual also had authorized unescorted physical access to Medium Impact Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber Systems, but was not authorized electronic access. The entity conducted an investigation to determine how the individual received the improperly granted electronic access and discovered that the individual shared the same last name with another who previously had authorized electronic access and that common last name led to the entity’s failure to identify the error during its quarterly review.

Second, the entity identified an issue with the configuration of several Cyber Assets that permits any individual user account to log into the Cyber Assets locally as long as the individual user account is in good standing (meaning the account’s password is not expired, the account is not disabled, and the account is not a service account). To log in through this configuration error, individual users must have physical access to the server console. This configuration error does not allow for the individual users to access the Cyber Assets remotely.

Third, the entity did not remove access to entity designated storage locations for BES Cyber System Information by July 1, 2016 for an individual with local and remote access to protected information under the entity’s CIP v3 repositories. The individual incorrectly retained access despite the entity’s determination that the individual no longer required access once the entity’s CIP v6 program became effective.

Fourth, during the entity’s Quarterly Access Review, the entity discovered that someone had assigned administrative rights to three server types to an incorrect Resource Group. The error provided a managing systems engineer, who was a member of that Resource Group, with access to all three server types even though he was not authorized for administrative access to those servers.

Fifth, multiple entity substation supervisors with authorized unescorted physical access to Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems at the entity's substations were erroneously provisioned unescorted physical access through the Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs) at the entity's Control Centers via the ""All CIP Doors"" clearance in the entity's Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). The entity discovered the error and promptly removed the “All CIP Doors” clearance and unauthorized physical access. After the removals, the entity began an investigation. During an investigation of this issue, the entity confirmed that the individuals:  

a. were unaware that they had been provisioned access to the Control Center PSPs; and 
b. did not at any time access or attempt to access a Control Center PSP.

Sixth, an entity temporary workforce employee was authorized and provisioned unescorted physical access to an entity PSP, but the entity did not update the CIP v3 list of individuals with authorized access to reflect the access and authorization due to confusion during the transition of the entity's v3 access control process to the current v6 access control process.

This noncompliance involves the management practices of asset and configuration management, verification, and workforce management. Asset and configuration management is involved because the entity consistently failed to timely remove and grant authorized unescorted physical and electronic access. The entity did not have an effective internal control in place to ensure that access was properly removed and granted and that lack of an effective internal control is a root cause of this noncompliance. The entity was also heavily reliant on the use of manual processes that were subject to human error. Verification is also involved because the entity did not consistently or effectively verify that its access revocations and grants were proper. Workforce management is involved because the entity did not properly train its employees to timely remove and grant authorized unescorted physical and electronic access. 
",CIP-004-6,R4,Medium,High,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS) based on the following factors. The risk posed by this violation is that access by unauthorized personnel could result in harm to the integrity of BES Cyber Systems or the reliability of the BPS as a result of intentional compromise or misuse. Further elevating the risk, several of the violations could have been exploited to cause harm to BES Cyber Assets (BCAs) and thus could have had an impact on the BPS. The two instances that posed the most significant risk were allowing individuals' access to jump hosts that are a defense to prevent unauthorized interactive remote access into an Electronic Security Perimeter and allowing individuals to have administrative access to BCA windows devices. The risk is moderated because each of the six instances were discovered and reported quickly and had relatively short durations. The risk is further moderated because all individuals in each of the six instances had previously completed NERC CIP training and had up to date PRAs. Lastly, there was no actual impact to the BPS.

No harm is known to have occurred.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 1 (RFC_URE1),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016016444,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-004-6 R5. An entity employee transferred roles from a market function employee position with authorized unescorted physical access and electronic access to a subset of High Impact Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber Systems to a transmission function employee with authorized unescorted physical access and electronic access to a different set of High Impact BES Cyber Systems. The individual’s prior electronic access which he no longer required in his new position was not removed until approximately three months later. The entity discovered this violation during a Quarterly Review and mitigated it with the implementation of the entity’s system tool.

The entity did not assign the change management ticket that was created for the revocation of electronic access for the employee that transferred from a market function employee position to a transmission function employee position to all of the applicable entity Operations Technology Engineers/Specialists necessary to ensure that all of the employee’s electronic access rights that were no longer permissible were revoked. (The entity’s change management process in effect at the time of this error was a manual process relying on human interaction to create tasks for each respective System Owner to remove access.  The System Owners in this case were not all notified. The entity has rectified this issue by implementing email alerts within their system tool.) The entity determined that an error in assigning the change management ticket was the cause of the delay in the removal of electronic access.

This noncompliance involves the management practices of verification, validation, and workforce management. Verification is involved because the entity failed to verify that employee’s prior electronic access was removed once the employee transferred positions. The entity did not have an effective internal control in place to ensure that the employee’s prior electronic access was timely removed when he transferred roles. That lack of an effective internal control is a root cause of this noncompliance. Weaknesses in workforce management are broadly involved because multiple violations arose from an inability to properly manage access for employees in temporary or transitional roles.  ",CIP-004-6,R5,Medium,Lower,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS) based on the following factors. The risk posed by this violation is allowing an individual to access BES Cyber Systems when that individual is no longer authorized to have such access.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 1 (RFC_URE1),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016016438,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE1 submitted Self-Reports to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R3. This violation includes four separate instances. The entity discovered these four instances of failing to apply patches within the 30-day requirement while manually performing the 35-day patch assessments.

First, a security patch was released for an agent on the entity's High Impact Bulk Electric System Cyber Systems and Electronic Access Control or Monitoring systems (EACMS). The entity discovered that there was an additional applicable system component of the agent patch that had not been assessed for applicability. This resulted in an assessment of the security patch for the entity EACMS using the system more than 35 days after the patch's release. The assessment of the security patch for the system components was completed but the security patch was not applied to the applicable systems until approximately 50 days later.  The entity now tracks available patches for systems separately to avoid confusion.

Second, the entity visited the patch source for a Critical Cyber Asset subject to the entity's manual security patch management process to identify available security patches and updates. No security patches or updates had been released at that time but firmware was released by the source a few days later. The entity did not revisit the patch source website until approximately 40 days later. As such, the assessment of the firmware was overdue by several days. . The entity's current process requires patch sources to be visited with more frequency in order to avoid missing the 35-day assessment window.

Third, an engineer was navigating through a vendor website and identified that the page previously identified in the entity security patch management program as the source for security patch releases was incorrect and that this error had led the entity to miss a software update that was released. The engineer corrected the source in the entity's security patch management program and assessed the software update. The software update was then implemented on the session hosts. This issue impacts several devices currently identified by the entity as EACMS. The entity mitigated the issue when the source was updated and the updated software update was assessed and implemented .

Fourth, an engineer changed a filter he was using in a piece of software and identified that a version update had been released. The engineer had previously been running a report filtered by vendor to identify applicable releases for his Cyber Assets. The version update was released by a different vendor and had been filtered out of the report. When the filter was removed, the engineer identified that the entity's session hosts were running a different version when security software showed an applicable version which addresses a hijacking vulnerability in prior versions. Because of the error in filtering, the entity did not assess the updated version within the 35 days for several devices identified as entity EACMS. The issue was mitigated when different software was implemented on the session hosts. In addition, an email was sent to other engineers using the security software to identify applicable releases to advise responsible engineers to ensure that filtering is removed when using Lumension going forward.

This noncompliance involves the management practices of workforce management, verification, and external interdependencies management. Workforce management is involved because the entity failed to train staff effectively regarding how to locate, assess, and implement different types of patches and that is a root cause of this noncompliance. Verification is involved because the entity did not have an effective internal control in place to verify that the entity was timely assessing and implementing these patches. External interdependencies is involved because entity staff failed to implement the patch updates recommended by external patch consultants.",CIP-007-3a,R3,Lower,High,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS) based on the following factors. The risk posed by this violation is the opportunity for infiltration of unauthorized network traffic into the Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) when security patches and upgrades are not installed on Cyber Assets within the ESP. Additionally, for the third and fourth instances, several devices had a known vulnerability that was not addressed for more than four months. The risk is moderated because of the short duration of two of the four individual instances.  Lastly, ReliabilityFirst notes that there is no evidence of any harm to the BPS resulting from these patching failures during the violation.

2) developed draft training regarding proper use of software, including when filtering may and may not be used;
3) developed draft training to address patch assessment and deployment timing requirements;
4) finalized training;
5) completed and implemented tracking and alerting objectives in OT Service Management;
6) deployed training to responsible engineers and specialists; and
7) updated security patch management program documentation to reflect use of OT Service Management System.

These steps should eliminate or reduce the risk of a recurrence of the issues that gave rise to the Self-Reports addressed herein. The entity will be looking into more in-depth and robust technical solutions to either augment the assessment/deployment technical shortcomings of its current patch deployment tool, or research or designate a separate tool as a complete replacement.

The entity is establishing tracking and alerting objectives in its new OT service management tool based on a set schedule consistent with the timing requirements within the entity's security patch management program, which are designed to ensure available patches are assessed and deployed within the 35-day thresholds. These tracking and alerting objectives will include a trigger notification to responsible personnel as well as escalation of the ticket to management as needed for timely resolution. This new tracking and notification approach will be applied to Cyber Assets centrally managed through the entity's patch deployment tool as well as to the limited number of Cyber Assets for whom security patches are still managed manually.

For this new OT service management system:

Patch Assessments 
Patch assessment tickets for each of the documented patch sources and approved software on applicable BCS, EACMS, and PACS will be automatically created. Upon receipt of the notification of the creation of the patch assessment ticket, the assessments will be assigned to an individual engineer or specialist (the agent), either through self-assignment (i.e., an agent picking up the ticket and assigning to him or herself) or by the group leader, as warranted, to ensure assignments are not made to an engineer or specialist who is out of the office.

Patch Deployments
Until such time that a manner of automation can be discovered and implemented within the OT service management system, the following will be performed by the agent:

1. The ticket to deploy the software assessed to be applicable will be created by the agent.
2. The due date will be calculated by the agent and assigned to the ticket to be 35 days from the date of the assessment.

To ensure the timely completion of the ticket, a system of notifications will be created within the OT service management system to email the agent, their group leader and their manager on an escalating basis until the ticket has been resolved.

Patch Source Verifications 
RFC_URE1 shall verify the validity of documented security patch sources for all High and Medium BCS, EACMS, and PACS that have software that was not integrated into RFC_URE1's automated security patch management tool. Responsible personnel shall verify the correct patch source has been documented in the program by searching the source identified in RFC_URE1 's program documentation for the existence of the most recent, applicable, previously released patch - if no patches appear to have been made available through the source, RFC_URE1 will conduct further investigation to confirm that the identified source is correct. A new field will be added within the OT service management system to track the date of the last source verification. This verification will be performed twice a year, and created and due within the same time frame of the patch assessment that occurs within that month.

To ensure the timely completion of the ticket, a system of notifications will be created within the OT service management system to email the agent, their group leader and their manager on an escalating basis until the ticket has been resolved.",9/21/2017,12/5/2017,Stipulates,"ReliabilityFirst considered entity's internal compliance program (ICP) and considered it to be a mitigating factor in the penalty determination.

This violation includes two separate instances of failing to monitor or review logged events. The entity discovered the two instances while reviewing logs during an alert, and while performing a self-audit. 

In the first instance, the server infrastructure in the entity's Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) at the backup location lost access to the network housing the systems for that location. The systems are used to aggregate CIP-007 security event monitoring logs from applicable systems within the ESP. The entity’s investigation into this violation discovered that the following issues occurred: 1) one of the two physical network connections was down due to a support switch hardware failure; 2) a configuration error in the virtual systems that host the servers prohibited use of the redundant connection; and 3) the redundant firewalls were also connected to the failed support switch, but were not configured to monitor the failed uplink interface for failure. The entity restored logging and alerting through the systems after reconfiguring the virtual hosts to allow for use of the redundant connection and performing a manual failover of the firewall to restore network traffic. The entity was unable to recover the system security event logs for the period of the outage.

In the second instance, the entity determined that it had failed to review a sampling of logged events for one of its identified Electronic Access Control or Monitoring systems (EACMS) for High Impact Bulk Electric System Cyber Systems (BCS). Although this issue was originally thought to be limited to one device, after an investigation was performed, the entity discovered that several devices were affected by this issue which are all High Impact BCS or their associated EACMS.

This noncompliance involves the management practices of workforce management and asset and configuration management. Workforce management is involved because the entity failed to train staff to frequently review a sampling of logged events for one of its identified EACMS and that failure to train staff is a root cause of this noncompliance. Asset and configuration management is involved because entity staff caused these violations through multiple configuration errors.   ",CIP-007-6,R4,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS) based on the following factors. The risk posed by the first issue is that for an approximately 12 hour period, the entity was not monitoring the logs for these devices which could potentially impede the entity’s ability to identify and investigate Cyber Security incidents. For the second issue, the moderate risk arises from the large number of High Impact BCS devices that were not integrated into the entity’s monitoring system meaning logs for those devices were not being reviewed. The risk is lessened because the entity discovered both instances while reviewing logs during an alert and by performing a self-audit in preparation for the entity’s upcoming audit.

ReliabilityFirst considered the entity's CIP-007-6 R5 and CIP-007-3 R5 (corresponding version 3 requirement) compliance history and determined there were no relevant instances of noncompliance.
"
ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 1 (RFC_URE1),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016016436,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE1 submitted Self-Reports to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-010-2 R1. This violation includes six separate instances.

First, in preparation for CIP v5 standards implementation, the entity developed two systems. The two systems were connected to an Active Directory account for the purpose of functional testing. It was determined that the backup at its other location was not going to be used for access control and monitoring due to an issue with the data feed but the connection to the Active Directory account was not severed. The server was properly identified as an Electronic Access Control or Monitoring System (EACMS) because of the connection to the new production Active Directory account and the ability to make access changes through that account to the energy management system (EMS) and Electronic Security Perimeter firewalls. However, the engineer responsible for the server failed to integrate the server into the CIP v5 program because the device was not being used for access control or monitoring and he considered it to still be a test device. In preparing the Attachment C for the Compliance Audit, the entity identified the error and, initially believing it to be a device misidentification, removed the EACMS classification from the server. A managing systems engineer identified a change in the classification and investigated the matter further determining that the connection to the production Active Directory account was still active. The matter was escalated and the connection to the production Active Directory account was severed. 

Second, a systems engineer mistakenly deployed software updates via the entity's security patch management tool to the database server. While reviewing the installed software lists for CIP Devices, a senior systems engineer discovered the difference in the software list for the device from the previous month and initiated an investigation, which identified the erroneous deployment without authorization. The issue was mitigated when a change request was submitted to restore that affected device to the previously installed versions of the software, consistent with the baseline configuration. The entity also followed up with the systems engineer for the erroneous deployment to review best practices for deployments.

Third, software was erroneously deployed onto an entity EACMS. The software was removed.

Fourth, an entity Systems Administrator used the entity’s security patch management tool to inadvertently deploy software to several entity Critical Cyber Assets (CCAs) without appropriate change control or testing. The System Administrator was working on an approved change, installing software onto devices in a test environment, but accidentally selected production CCAs instead of test as the target systems. Upon recognizing the error, he reported the problem to the Senior Administrator who was able to suspend the process within a matter of minutes thereby limiting deployment.

Fifth, the entity uses a virtual machine (VM) to perform port scans for its Cyber Assets. The entity had originally planned to only enable the connection of these VMs to its Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber Systems (BCS) on a temporary basis as needed to perform scanning. Due to the frequency of port scanning performed the VMs have been left connected. As a result of the change in approach, responsible engineers  reevaluated the VMs' current designation under the entity's CIP program and contacted entity compliance raising concerns regarding the fact that the VMs were not classified.  Because these VMs had the capability of establishing Interactive Remote Access (IRA) through SSH to various High Impact BCS/BES Cyber Assets (BCA) within the entity's Electronic Security Perimeters, they should have been identified as Intermediate Systems. Since the VMs were not classified as Intermediate Systems and formally subject to appropriate protective measures under the entity's CIP program, this raises issues with the entity's ability to demonstrate compliance for these device for the following requirements: a. CIP-004-6 R4 and R5; b. CIP-005-5 R2; c. CIP-007-6 R1, R2, R4 Part 4.4, and R5 Parts 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4; d. CIP-009-6 R1; and e. CIP-010-2 R1 and R2. The entity disabled the ability of the VMs to use SSH outbound, and thereby terminated their IRA capability.

Sixth, the server was upgraded to the latest console release 8.5. As part of this release, a new version of the agent was made available in the console. The engineer responsible deployed the new agent to a group which he believed did not include any CIP-protected Cyber Assets. While the entity intended to deploy the new version of the agent to applicable CIP Cyber Assets, it had not intended to deploy the agent to these Cyber Assets yet as the CIP change management procedure, including testing requirements, had not yet been completed.

The entity identified that the group that received the new agent actually included one High Impact BCA (EMS workstation) and several EACMS and Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) associated with High Impact BCSs. Since the change management procedures had not been followed, the entity's automated program for security and threat detection detected the deployment of the new agent as an unauthorized change on the aforementioned Cyber Assets. The reconciler investigated and discovered that a change ticket for this change was absent but that the change was a ""desired"" change to the systems' baseline configurations as determined by the system owner.

A change management ticket was submitted to approve the change on BCAs and associated EACMS and PACS. The following were not performed prior to the change to the baseline configuration being implemented:
a. analysis of whether the CIP-005 and CIP-007 security controls that could be impacted as a result of the change were performed (CIP-010-2 R1 Part 1.4.1);
b. verification or determination as to whether the security controls noted above were impacted post-deployment (CIP-010-2 R1 Part 1.4.2);
c. documentation was composed of the verification results (CIP-010-2 R1 Part 1.4.3);
d. testing of the upgraded agent was conducted in the entity test environment prior to its deployment to the High Impact BCA (CIP-010-2 R1 Part 1.5.1); and
e. documentation of the testing results was conducted (CIP-010-2 R1 Part 1.5.2).

This noncompliance involves the management practices of asset and configuration management, and workforce management. Asset and configuration management is involved because the entity did not analyze security controls that could be impacted as a result of the change performed. That failure to analyze is a root cause of this noncompliance. Workforce management is involved because the entity staff did not verify or document whether the security controls were impacted post-deployment. In preparation for CIP v5 implementation, the entity developed two systems. The two systems were connected to an Aactive Ddirectory account for the purpose of functional testing. The entity determined that the backup at its other location was not going to be used for access control and monitoring due to an issue with the data feed, but the connection to the Active Directory account was not severed. 


",CIP-010-2,R1,Medium,High,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS) based on the following factors. The risk posed by this violation is permitting changes to be implemented that could adversely affect system security. The risk is moderate because the entity discovered each of these six instances of entity personnel failing to follow proper change control procedures. After discovering the first four instances which were included in the entity’s initial Self-Report, the entity conducted an extent of condition analysis as part of its mitigation efforts and that extent of condition discovered the final two instances.

ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),Unidentified Registered Entity 1 (RFC_URE1),NCRXXXXX,RFC2016016437,Settlement Agreement  ,"RFC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that it was in violation of CIP-010-2 R2. An entity system administrator determined that the entity failed to review the configuration baselines of Electronic Access Control or Monitoring Systems (EACMS) for changes within the required 35 day window. At the time of this violation, the entity used a manual process to review the baselines which required the intervention of an engineer. In this instance, the engineer did not review the baseline configurations within the required time frame.

This noncompliance involves the management practices of asset and configuration management and workforce management. Asset and configuration management is involved because the entity did not review the configuration baselines of multiple EACMS. The entity did not have an effective internal control in place to ensure that baseline configurations were timely reviewed. This lack of an effective internal control is a root cause of this noncompliance. Workforce management is involved because entity staff were not properly trained on how to perform the baseline review.

","WECC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report stating that it was in violation of CIP-006-3c R5.

Specifically, WECC_URE1 reported that it discovered six instances of potential noncompliance of CIP-006-3c R5 for not monitoring physical access at all access points to the Physical Security Perimeter (PSP) at five different substations.  Per WECC_URE1’s procedures, when the last employee onsite exits a PSP, they are to arm the physical security system so interior motion sensors can monitor for window breaches.  In six instances, WECC_URE1 employees did not arm the security system which caused the interior motion sensors to go offline.  As a result, windows within the PSP did not having monitoring capability for breaches of any kind.  For four of the instances, employees made no attempt to arm the security system when exiting the PSP.  The other two instances involved an employee entering an invalid pin and another employee cleared alarms which caused the alarm not to be armed.

WECC determined that WECC_URE1 failed to monitor physical access at all access points to the PSP twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week on six separate.

The root cause was employees not following procedures to ensure the physical security system alarm for monitoring access to windows in the PSP was enabled.

WECC determined the duration of the violation was restricted to six instances occurring during an approximate eight month period. Each instance lasted between approximately 20 minutes to 9 hours. 



",CIP-006-3c,R5,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system (BPS).  In this instance, WECC_URE1 failed to implement technical and procedural controls for monitoring physical access at all access points to the PSPs twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week as it relates to windows within the PSP.  If physical access is not monitored, the potential exists for nefarious individuals to interfere with operations, ultimately resulting in dropping load and/or affecting neighboring facilities. In the event that unauthorized access is granted, an unauthorized user could misoperate BPS elements. 

However, WECC_URE1 had some detective controls in place.  WECC_URE1 had video monitoring capabilities which they reviewed at several prescribed times throughout the day. All access doors to the PSPs continued to be monitored; that is door contacts, access controls, and electronic logging remained functional. WECC_URE1 reviewed the CCTV camera and alarm monitoring station system and confirmed there were no unauthorized access attempts during the duration of the violation.  Based on this, WECC determined that the violation posed a moderate risk to the reliability of the BPS.

","when WECC_URE1 resumed monitoring the physical access at all access points to the PSP for the last instance

",No Penalty,Self-Report,"To mitigate this violation, WECC_URE1:

1) enhanced its loss of security system monitoring response plan and its training program between the alarm monitoring station and dispatch, to include the deployment of resources for physical observation within 30 minutes of loss of remote security system monitoring;
2) trained appropriate personnel on the updated procedures; and
3) modified substations containing Medium Impact Bulk Electric System Cyber Assets that had operable windows to be fixed windows and not access points.

In addition to the mitigating activities, WECC_URE1 included the following preventive measures in its Mitigation Plan.

1) To address lapses in human performance associated with arming security systems, the alarm monitoring station conducts status checks of field sites each day at 1800 hours to determine if any sites have been left disarmed. Sites found disarmed are assessed for signs of malicious activity and then armed remotely. A security incident report is then completed with the name of the last individual on site. The responsible individual is then issued an internal security violation requiring the manager to address the employee's behavior.
2) WECC_URE1 has implemented a ""three strikes"" progressive security violation process. Each strike requires manager interaction to address the behavior. Individuals receiving a third strike (security violation) within a 12-month period will have their access revoked and remedial actions must occur (re-training, NERC CIP training, etc.) and concurrence from the WECC_URE1 vice president level to reinstate access.

","WECC_URE2 submitted a Self-Report stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-3a R5.1.2 and  R5.2.3. 

Specifically, for the first instance, WECC_URE2 reported that the password to a shared account on one Critical Cyber Asset (CCA) server was not changed pursuant to CIP-007-3a R5.2.3 following the voluntary termination of an employee with access to the shared account. During Version 5 implementation, WECC_URE2 determined that the shared account on the CCA server was not listed in WECC_URE2’s Identity and Access Management System; therefore; the password change was not initiated and went unchanged. The employee network and remote logical access was removed at termination of employment. The only type of available access to the server would be physical, which was also revoked at termination.

For the second instance, WECC_URE2 reported that during the replacement of two failed CCAs, WECC_URE2 did not generate logs of sufficient detail to create historical audit trails of individual user account access activity for a minimum of 90 days, pursuant to CIP-007-3a R5.1.2.  In both issues, WECC_URE2 performed work to replace a failed CCA per emergency change control procedures, at which time the technician did not configure the CCA to send syslog messages for successful and unsuccessful logon attempts to the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) collector.  The CCAs which convert analog signals from SCADA devices to digital signals that can be used by WECC_URE2’s Energy Management System (EMS) for monitoring and controlling the Bulk Electric System (BES).  WECC_URE2 discovered the second instance during a routine review of SIEM logs.

WECC reviewed the Self-Report and determined WECC_URE2 failed to change one administrative privilege level shared account password following the termination of an employee, and did not generate logs of sufficient detail to create historical audit trails of individuals user account activity for a minimum of 90 days.  

The root cause for the two instances of noncompliance were as follows:
a. Instance 1:  an employee did not follow documented procedures for reviewing or updating shared account passwords;
b. Instance 2:  a review of the change control actions as documented in WECC_URE2’s procedures were not performed prior to or after a change.

WECC determined that this violation began when for the first instance, a password should have been changed, and ended when the password was changed, for a total of 437 days of noncompliance.   For the second instance, the violation began when logs were not generated and ended when WECC_URE2 reestablished logging on the two devices in scope, for a total of 48 days of noncompliance.

In the first instance, WECC_URE2 failed to change one administrative privilege level shared account password.  Such failure could lead to the removal or disabling of technical controls which could result in unauthorized access services, power cycling or shutting down equipment, exposing or leaking data, introducing malware, loss of security event monitoring, or generating unauthorized or anomalous network protocol traffic; thereby potentially adversely impacting WECC_URE2’s ability to perform its functional obligations, including operations monitoring, control and coordination activities.   

In the second instance, WECC_URE2 failed to generate logs from two CCAs of sufficient detail to create historical audit trails of individual user account access activity for a minimum of 90 days.  Such failure could allow a bad actor to go undetected while investigating systems and potentially compromising those system with delays in information delivery, system freezes or reboots.

Specifically, for the first instance, WECC_URE2 implemented good preventive electronic and physical access internal controls which included a card reader system to detect unauthorized physical access, as well as network and Interactive Remote Access revocation procedures. Further, the employee network and remote logical access was removed at termination of employment. The only type of available access to the server would be physical, which was also revoked at termination.

For the both instances, a technician replaced a failed CCA and did not follow WECC_URE2’s documented test procedure to confirm that the new Critical Cyber Asset (CCAs) were sending syslog messages for successful and unsuccessful login attempts to WECC_URE2’s Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) collector.  The CCAs were serial servers, used to convert analog signals from supervisory control data and acquisition (SCADA) devices to digital signals to be used by WECC_URE2’s Energy Management System (EMS) for monitoring and controlling the Bulk Electric System (BES).

WECC_URE2 discovered this issue during a routine review of SIEM logs.  The two CCAs were replaced following emergency change control procedures that stipulate that restoration work may be completed before the associated change control paperwork is completed or reviewed.  Consequently, no review of the change control paperwork or the actions of the technician at the time of performing the replacement. 

The root cause of these issues was due to a technician not following documented procedures. Specifically, they did not utilize a checklist to document testing and changes performed.

WECC determined that WECC_URE2 failed to implement established and documented test procedures pursuant to CIP-007-3a R1.1 during the replacement of two CCAs that stopped functioning.

WECC determined the first and second instance when WECC_URE2 commissioned two CCAs into its EMS that were not configured to log, and ended on when WECC_URE2 configured both CCAs to log, for a total of 47 days, and 26 days of noncompliance, respectively.

In this instance, WECC_URE2 failed to implement established and documented test procedures during the replacement of two CCAs that stopped functioning. Such failure could introduce inadvertent changes (new accounts, new ports/services, vulnerabilities, etc.), as well as remove required services, eliminating the capability to log to the SIEM servers. Additionally, not monitoring for user logon activity could have allowed a brute force login or other unauthorized access attempts to go undetected.  The lack of security controls testing could have added unprotected (default/no passwords) user accounts which could have been utilized to gain unauthorized access with full control to the unauthorized user.

Specifically, WECC_URE2 reported that it did not dispose of a Critical Cyber Asset (CCA) in accordance with its established and documented procedures.  The power supply of a CCA failed, rendering it inoperable.  A technician replaced the failed CCA utilizing emergency change control procedures.  After completing the work, the technician neglected to follow WECC_URE2’s established procedures for disposal of a CCA.  The procedures stipulate that the restoration work may be completed before the associated change control paperwork is completed or reviewed.  Consequently, no review of the change control paperwork was performed at the time of the restoration.  WECC_URE2 discovered this noncompliance during a review of change controls.  During the review WECC_URE2 learned that instead of placing the failed hardware in one of the designated CCA hardware disposal bins within the designated Physical Security Perimeter (PSP), as required by WECC_URE2’s disposal of Cyber Assets procedures, the failed hardware was deposited in a general recycling bin that is not located within an PSP.  An investigation into the circumstances of this emergency change control revealed that the employee who performed the work inadvertently neglected to follow WECC_URE2’s disposal procedures, despite having recently receiving CIP refresher training on change control procedures.

WECC determined that WECC_URE2 failed to dispose of a CCA in accordance with its established and documented procedures as required by CIP-007-3a R7.1.

The root cause was due to an employee neglecting to follow documented procedures for disposing of CCAs.

",CIP-007-3a ,R7; R7.1,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the BPS.  In this instance, WECC_URE2 failed to follow its documented procedures for the handling, storage and destruction of data storage media to prevent unauthorized retrieval of sensitive cyber security or reliability data as required in CIP-007-3a R7 for one CCA device.  Such failure could expose sensitive cyber security and/or reliability information contained on the CCA (IP address, accounts, passwords, Energy Management System (EMS) communications, end-point identification, etc.) to knowledge based malicious attacks.  The more information that is known about an WECC_URE2’s operational environment, the easier it is to design an effective malicious attack.  This CCA contained control center and transmission based EMS communication information.  The evidence of destruction provided to WECC_URE2 was weak, and therefore, increased the risk associated with the potential impacts.  Successful attacks against these devices could significantly impact the operational state of the BPS, including complete loss of EMS visibility and control to the end-point devices that communicate through them.  WECC_URE2 has a significant number of interties with other regional entities that could also be affected by this type of attack, as well as their connected WECC paths.

However, the harm associated with not disposing of a CCA appropriately had a minimal likelihood of occurring.  WECC_URE2 does have a documented procedure and checklist in place for proper disposal of Cyber Assets; and includes in its initial and annual refresher training, a section on change management and the proper disposal and redeployment of Cyber Assets.  The devices and systems exposed to a malicious event resulting from this failure, reside within a Physical Security Perimeter (PSP) and an Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) with access controls in place, including monitoring and strong access authentication.  The traffic through these devices and systems is monitored by the EMS system which would have detected abnormal activity.  Additionally, WECC_URE2 has a pre-implementation and post-installation compliance review procedure, which is how this violation was discovered.

",Settlement Agreement,"WECC_URE3 submitted a Self-Report stating that it was in violation with CIP-006-3c R1.7. Specifically, WECC_URE3 reported that a fire protection project was started to provide emergency egress for control room operators. A hole was cut in the external concrete wall of the project Physical Security Perimeter (PSP) at the intake deck level. After the hole was cut, a slab of steel was placed over the hole to prevent entry into the PSP. Later, the contractor removed the steel plate and put forms up and poured concrete walls around the entry point. Entry was again prevented by installing a temporary door with a lock. The prime contractor was the only person with a key to the door at that time. Once the concrete was cured in the walls, the contractor installed the permanent steel door that was cored with a construction lock with, again, only one key in the possession of the prime contractor. A door lock was later installed and only project operators had a key to that lock. A newly hired compliance coordinator noticed that the door did not have a proximity card reader on it like the other PSP access points. After doing some research, they learned that it was the newly constructed fire escape egress door which was built as part of the powerhouse fire protection project, which had not yet been completed.

WECC determined that WECC_URE3 failed to update its physical security plan within thirty calendar days of completing a reconfiguration of an additional access point to the PSP as required by CIP-006-3c R1.7.

The root cause of the violation was a lack of understanding of the CIP requirements and the need to update physical security plans within 30 calendar days of changes.

WECC determined that this issue began 30 calendar days after an access point was added to the PSP and the physical security plan was not updated, and ended when the physical security plan was updated with the access point, for approximately 900 days of noncompliance.",CIP-006-3c,R1; R1.7,Lower,Severe,"This violation posed a minimal risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system.

",Unidentified Registered Entity 4 (WECC_URE4),NCRXXXXX,"WECC2014013531











",Settlement Agreement,"WECC_URE4 submitted a Self-Certification stating that it was in violation of CIP-006-3c R5. Specifically, WECC_URE4 reported that it failed to follow procedures to immediately review and handle unauthorized access attempts.

After receiving the report from WECC_URE4, WECC further investigated the issue, by having several discussions with WECC_URE4 and issuing multiple data requests. Specifically, WECC issued a Data Request to the entity during the Self-Certification issues to confirm the results of entity’s full scope assessment. WECC discovered WECC_URE4 had multiple issues with monitoring its physical access, which originated with an earlier version of the applicable Standard, CIP-006-1 R3. Additionally, the entity attested during Completion of Mitigation Plan certification that there is no additional scope expansion. This was further verified by a WECC risk analyst during the Completion of Mitigation Plan review. 

The first issue is that WECC_URE4 failed to respond to alerts generated at its Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for an actual unauthorized access attempt to a Physical Security Perimeter (PSP). The unauthorized attempt resulted in the individual gaining forced entry into a substation PSP for an extended period and damaging equipment within the PSP. WECC_URE4 had been receiving a large number of ""phantom"" alerts for other systems monitored by its SCADA system. The operators monitoring the physical security alerts received ""door open"" alerts from a PSP, but assumed these were also “phantom” alerts, so they did not review the alerts any further or dispatch personnel to investigate. As a result, an individual was able to gain forced entry into a substation PSP for an extended period and damage equipment within the PSP.  WECC_URE4 did not discover the break in until the following day. WECC_URE4 noted that it conducted a review following the incident and found that the individual in scope did not damage any CIP equipment during the unauthorized physical intrusion. In the course of follow-up investigations, it was determined that while the initial break-in occurred the morning of Saturday, the resultant SCADA alarms were not responded to as they were deemed not credible by the dispatchers on duty. Additionally, the door alarms did not at that time connect to the intrusion detection system monitored by WECC_URE4 physical security

The second issue WECC_URE4 had with monitoring its physical access was discovered while investigating the cause of the first issue. WECC discovered that WECC_URE4 failed to document and implement a process that could allow for immediate notification of unauthorized access attempts to PSPs. Specifically, WECC discovered that WECC_URE4's physical security team was not viewing alerts during off-business hours (i.e. after 5:00 pm on weekdays, and on weekends) for substations. WECC_URE4 stated that, as SCADA was able to receive notices when a PSP access point was opened, WECC_URE4 had a process in place to move responsibility of monitoring PSPs during off-business hours to the SCADA team. Through additional investigation, WECC discovered that the SCADA team could only see if a PSP door was opened, but could not see other alerts that would have been generated by the Physical Access Control System (PACS), such as the unauthorized access attempts alert, door held open alert, or the door forced open alert. As SCADA alerts were the only physical monitoring tool in place during off-business hours, the SCADA alerts were unable to immediately notify responsible personnel of unauthorized access attempts.

The cause of these issues was inadequate procedures that led the individuals involved to underestimate the problem, using past events as a basis for their physical access protections, and the data quality from notification systems was less than adequate. The on-duty dispatchers incorrectly made an assumption that the door alarm was a false alarm due to either a SCADA system fault or possibly door movement due to wind and thus failed to take the immediate procedural action. This false assumption was based upon a trend in actual or perceived false alarms following a SCADA upgrade 21 months earlier. This alarms trend, identified as phantom alarms, were at times confused with nuisance alarms (essentially the toggling of an alarm point due to various conditions, environmental, hardware, etc. that lead to a seemingly simultaneous initialization and clearing of an alarm point) were perceived as not credible and thus ignored or not deemed credible.",CIP-006-1 ,R3,Medium,Severe,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system.  In this instance, WECC_URE4 had two separate issues with monitoring physical access. In the first issue, WECC_URE4 failed to respond to alerts generated at its SCADA system for an actual unauthorized access into a PSP. Failing to adequately review and respond to alerts at PSPs could and, in this case, did allow unauthorized access to the PSP to go unnoticed and unchecked. This access allowed a malicious person to gain physical access to cyber assets within the PSP and could have been used to damage, destroy, or compromise the cyber assets within the PSP that are essential to the reliable operation of the substation Critical Asset. Specifically, the individual could have used forcible means to damage and destroy Critical Cyber Assets (CCAs) or the individual could have gained logical access to the devices. Once access to the devices is attained the individual could have tampered with the communication system and the control room could have lost the visibility of the substation. This could have led to operators at the control room being blind and unable to detect or respond to faults in the line at the substation in scope.

In the second issue, WECC_URE4 failed to document and implement a process that could allow for immediate notification of unauthorized access attempts to PSPs. Failing to review unauthorized access attempts would leave an entity unaware of potential malicious users probing the physical defenses of its PSPs. Being unaware of such activities increases the risk of malicious activity going unnoticed or vulnerabilities being discovered and exploited. Unauthorized physical access to these PSPs could allow a malicious individual to compromise the cyber assets that are essential to the WECC_URE4's Critical Assets within these PSPs, potentially compromising reliable operation of the substations in scope. 

However, WECC_URE4 implemented good preventative controls to prevent an individual from affecting its load. Specifically, WECC_URE4 devices were restricted from logical access via username and password with strong restrictions, reducing the likelihood an individual with physical access would be able to control the CCAs in scope. Additionally, WECC_URE4 ensured all devices implemented malicious software prevention tools to reduce the likelihood of an individual with physical access installing a virus using a USB or disk drive. Lastly, WECC_URE4 ensured current patches were installed on all devices to reduce the risk of known vulnerabilities being used to compromise the devices in scope.

WECC_URE4 also implemented detective controls to detect access to its CCAs. Specifically, WECC_URE4 implemented logical logging of the devices in scope. If a malicious user unsuccessfully attempted to log in to the machines, the system would eventually generate an alert to notify response personnel. SCADA was monitoring physical security alerts and would have been alerted if a physical security access point was opened. Additionally, WECC_URE4 implemented Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras for forensic logging and monitoring in the case of a detected event.  

As further compensation, WECC_URE4's System Operators and Maintenance have monitoring and control implemented for the substation Bulk Electric System (BES) and communications assets.  Procedural controls exist for maintaining and correcting problems in the BES.  Additionally, WECC_URE4 has individual procedures for each substation and transmission line, so every component in the electrical grid that  WECC_URE4's Balancing Authority operates has a procedure for reference for WECC_URE4 System Operators.  Consequently, potential loss of the substations in scope due to physical access to CCAs would be mitigated by various emergency operating procedures. 
",when the Standard became mandatory and enforceable on WECC_URE4,"when WECC_URE4 revised the dispatch alarm procedure and reengineered the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to provide door alarms at the substation in scope to the security operations center, to allow them to monitor door status in addition to the dispatcher monitoring via the SCADA system

WECC,Unidentified Registered Entity,NCRXXXXX,WECC2016016233,,,CIP-003-3,"R4, R5",,,,,,"$2,700,000 ",,,,,,
ReliabilityFirst Corporation (ReliabilityFirst),"American Electric Power Service Corporation as agent for Appalachian Power Company, Indiana Michigan Power Company, Kentucky Power Company, Kingsport Power Company, Ohio Power Company, Wheeling Power Company, AEP Ohio Transmission Company, AEP Appalachian Transmission Company, AEP West Virginia Transmission Company, AEP Indiana Michigan Transmission Company and AEP Kentucky Transmission Company, Inc. (AEP)",NCR00682,RFC2016016427,Settlement Agreement   ,"On October 21, 2016, AEP submitted a Self-Report to ReliabilityFirst stating that, as a Transmission Owner, it was in violation of FAC-008-3 R6.  Within the facility ratings database, the equipment inventory list for the 301, 302, and 303 transformer facilities did not account for two riser sections—a span of 4 x 4 x ¼ inch aluminum angle conductor and a span of 2 inch aluminum bus tubing. This was inconsistent with the entity’s Facility Ratings Methodology and resulted in an inaccurate, higher rating for all three transformer facilities. 

For example, prior to the identification of the violation, the Winter Normal Facility Ratings were as follows: 758 MVA for Transformer 301; 816 MVA for Transformer 302; and 775 MVA for Transformer 303. The corrected Winter Normal Facility Rating for all three Transformers was 454 MVA.  Similarly, prior to the identification of the violation, the Winter Emergency Facility Ratings were as follows: 840 MVA for Transformer 301; 900 MVA for Transformer 302; and 911 MVA for Transformer 303. The corrected Winter Emergency Facility Rating for all three Transformers was 501 MVA.

On March 22, 2016, the entity identified the violation during an upgrade construction project.  The entity was able to identify the issue due to an improved Facility Ratings process.  Upon identification, the entity notified PJM of the transformer de-rates based on the lower two-inch aluminum tubing rating.  By April 14, 2016, all spans of two-inch tubing were replaced with five-inch tubing. The facility rating, transmission operations, and PJM databases were all updated by May 11, 2016, to reflect the changes to each of the facilities equipment lists.

During the time Transformer 301 was energized (approximately 556 days throughout the two year violation duration) the transformer branch flow exceeded the reduced emergency rating (the rating that should have been applied to the Facility) 3.6 percent of the time.   During the time Transformer 302 was energized (approximately 488 days), the transformer branch flow exceeded the reduced emergency rating 2.2 percent of the time.   During the time Transformer 303 was energized (approximately 107 days), the transformer branch flow did not exceed the reduced ratings.  Additionally, it should be noted that throughout the two-year duration of the violation, there were no events at the Kammer station that adversely affected the reliability of the Bulk Electric System (BES).

The major contributing causes included a human performance issue related to not following the Facility Ratings process and a lack of sufficient verification controls to ensure proper modeling of ratings within the ratings database.  After a construction project was completed, changes to the facility elements were to be reflected in the ratings database.  The entity’s Facility Ratings process required that riser sections be included in the ratings calculation, but in this case, the risers were overlooked for these three transformers, and thus were not updated in the database following the construction project. 




",FAC-008-3,R6,Medium,Lower,"This violation posed a moderate risk and did not pose a serious or substantial risk to the reliability of the bulk power system based on the following factors.  The risk of not including the risers in the facility rating was that the overall capacity of the two-inch tubing could have been exceeded for two years, thus diminishing the integrity of the riser sections.  Continued loading of these elements above acceptable loading levels could result in deterioration of the elements’ strength, thereby reducing the expected service life resulting in possible future equipment failure.  

However, this risk is mitigated here based on the following factors.  First, the overall capacity of the two inch tubing was rarely exceeded (ranging from zero to 3.6 percent of the time the transformers were energized), thus reducing the likelihood of equipment failure. ReliabilityFirst reviewed each exceedance, including the duration and magnitude of each exceedance. For Kammer Transformer 301 Branch, the maximum exceedance of the seasonal emergency ratings was 30.7% in the summer (for 13 hours) and 38.9% in the winter (for 18 hours).  For Kammer Transformer 302 Branch, the maximum exceedance of the seasonal emergency ratings was 51.8% in the summer (for 14 hours) and 43.9% in the winter (for 16 hours). 

Second, even if there was an equipment failure, it is highly unlikely that all three transformers would be affected at the same time because the loading on each of the transformers varied, and therefore the rate of impact would be different for each transformer.  If one of the risers failed, thus causing a transformer to trip, the configuration of the station is such that there are multiple additional paths through which electricity could flow.  Third, regarding impact to the equipment itself, if a riser failed, the integrity of the transformer and other associated equipment would not be compromised, and thus only the riser section would need to be replaced.  Lastly, this violation affected only three transformers and did not involve a systemic issue with the entity’s Facility Ratings Process, and the entity self-identified the violation through a leading practice of continuous improvement with respect to its Facility Ratings Process.  Accordingly, the violation posed moderate risk to the reliability of the bulk power system.  No harm is known to have occurred.

5) will develop and implement a detective internal control to perform a Facility Rating review on periodically sampled Facilities;
6) will develop and implement preventive internal control to ensure proper modeling of ratings within the Facility Ratings database;
7) will complete ratings data validation for all of the applicable Facilities; and
8) will update internal records, as appropriate, based on the results of the validation process, and make appropriate notifications.",10/2/2018 (approved completion date),TBD,"Admits

","AEP identified and reported the violation at issue in this Settlement Agreement.  As a result, ReliabilityFirst seeks to encourage this type of self-reporting, characterized by self-detection and correction unconnected to a pending regional compliance monitoring action, by applying mitigating credit. 

ReliabilityFirst also considered the entity’s FAC-008 R6 compliance history in determining the penalty.  The entity’s relevant prior noncompliance with FAC-008 R6 includes NERC Violation ID RFC2015014576.  A Find, Fix and Track Report (FFT) informational posting addressing a noncompliance with FAC-008-3 R6 was posted on the NERC website on January 30, 2017.  The prior noncompliance is distinguishable from the instant violation because the prior noncompliance resulted from the Planning department increasing the winter emergency rating of a facility and failing to communicate that change to the Protection and Control Engineering department so that the Protection and Control Engineering department could calculate a new relay trip limit.  Conversely, here, the violation relates to failing to include rise sections in the Facility Ratings Database so that they could be considered when calculating the Facility Ratings Database. ReliabilityFirst determined that the entity's compliance history should not serve as a basis for aggravation.  

ReliabilityFirst reviewed AEP’s internal compliance program and applied some mitigating credit.  In late 2013, as evidence of its strong internal compliance program, AEP began an effort to review its Facility Ratings process to increase efficiency and prevent errors.  Prior to this effort, Transmission Planning engineers were responsible for ensuring all equipment was documented in the ratings database.  This was accomplished by reading electrical assembly drawings and manually entering the equipment into the database.  In 2013, a cross-functional team was tasked with reviewing the existing ratings process for efficiency improvements.  The end product, AEP Transmission’s “Transmission Facility Rating Process,” outlined the process to follow for planned new construction, planned equipment change, unplanned equipment change, emergency work, methodology change, ratings capability review, and data error corrections.  Additionally, AEP added the role of Facility Ratings Coordinator to serve as a subject matter expert for reliability compliance requirements and documentation related to Transmission Facility Ratings. The Facility Ratings Coordinator is responsible for application and oversight of the Facility Ratings Process for all AEP Transmission system facilities.  AEP identified the current violation by following the updated Facility Rating Process for a planned equipment change at the Kammer Station.  The updated process included processes to follow for various scenarios including planned new construction, planned equipment change, unplanned equipment change, emergency work, methodology change, ratings capability review, and data error corrections.  Having documented processes for specific scenarios provided a means for those responsible to communicate changes that could affect Facility Ratings.  Additionally, as part of the current Mitigation Plan, Transmission is reviewing all of the applicable Facilities, 1,644 branches, to ensure that they are rated according to its methodology.  The review started with the Facilities above 200 kV and will proceed to the remainder of the BES Facilities through October, 2018.

Additionally, AEP has been highly cooperative throughout the enforcement process.

SERC_URE1 submitted a Self-Report stating that it was in violation of CIP-007-6 R5, P5.7. SERC_URE1 did not limit the number of unsuccessful authentication attempts nor generate alerts after a threshold of unsuccessful authentication attempts, where technically feasible, for 18 Cyber Assets that included Medium Impact Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber Systems at control centers and associated Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) and Protected Cyber Assets (PCAs), and did not submit a Technical Feasibility Exception (TFE) documenting compensating measures where such action was not technically feasible.

While conducting an inventory of Cyber Assets in preparation for CIP Version 5 compliance, SERC_URE1 IT department personnel discovered ten Cyber Assets, associated with two Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems, that did not limit the number of unsuccessful authentication attempts nor generate alerts after a threshold of unsuccessful authentication attempts. The control centers' Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems had ten similar Cyber Assets involved. 

SERC_URE1 submitted Technical Feasibility Exception (TFE) requests for two Cyber Assets to SERC, which SERC approved.  SERC_URE1 corrected a configuration error, which allowed the generation of alerts for two Cyber Asset devices after reaching a threshold of unsuccessful authentication attempts. 

During its assessment of the violation, SERC auditors discovered eight additional Cyber Assets that did not limit the number of unsuccessful authentication attempts nor generate alerts after a threshold of unsuccessful authentication attempts, where technically feasible. SERC_URE1 used the Cyber Assets as PACS door controllers. SERC_URE1 located eight of these door controllers at the control centers. The door controllers had no capability to limit or alert upon unsuccessful authentication attempts, but SERC_URE1 had not filed TFE requests for them. SERC_URE1 later submitted TFE requests for the eight PACS door controllers to SERC, which SERC approved.

SERC determined the violation occurred for approximately three months.

In summary, SERC_URE1 now has approved TFEs that cover the eight PACS controllers and two Cyber Assets, both under CIP-007-6 R5.7. All the other Cyber Assets were capable of the alerting required by CIP-007-6 R5.7.
